# Integrating React into apps

## Integration Points

React components are typically mounted to specific DOM elements within Jinja templates, creating a seamless integration:

```javascript
// Example of mounting a React component to a DOM element from a Jinja template
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { RecordActions } from "./components";

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  const mountPoint = document.getElementById("record-actions");
  if (mountPoint) {
    const recordId = mountPoint.dataset.recordId;
    ReactDOM.render(<RecordActions recordId={recordId} />, mountPoint);
  }
});
```

Note that sometimes you can have multiple small react applications embedded in jinja/jinjax template.
In certain cases, where there is no need for a react app, it is possible to embed vanilla javascript onto a page (jquery is also available inside of the repo).

## Procedure for adding a javascript entry point:

1. Write your javascript code. The code shall be in the javascript section in the "theme" folder, which is
   semantic-ui in the example above.
2. in webpack.py, in the entry section, you shall provide the entry point name and the path to the
   entry point, relative to the theme folder (semantic-ui in this case)

```
theme = WebpackThemeBundle(
    __name__,
    ".",
    default="semantic-ui",
    themes={
        "semantic-ui": dict(
            entry={
                "documents_search": "./js/documents/search/index.js",
                "documents_deposit_form": "./js/documents/forms/index.js",
            },
            dependencies={
                "react-dnd-test-backend": "^16.0.1",
                "@oarepo/file-manager": "^1.1.0",
            },
            devDependencies={},
            aliases={"@js/documents": "./js/documents"},
        )
    },
)
```

3. In your jinja template, you need to include this entry point as such:

In our example, this would be embedded into Deposit.jinja template, as it is entry point for the form.

```
{%- block javascript %}
{{ super() }}
{{ webpack['documents_deposit_form.js'] }}
{%- endblock %}
```
4. After you add a new entry point, it will be necessary to rebuild the javascript "manually" in order
for this entry point to actually be available. This is done by running the following commands in your venv:

```
invenio webpack clean create
invenio webpack install
```
