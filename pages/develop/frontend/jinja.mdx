# Template rendering with Jinja

Jinja is the powerful templating engine used in Invenio for server-side rendering of HTML pages. This section will guide you through the basics of working with Jinja templates in your Invenio-based repository application, including key concepts, template inheritance, and best practices.

Jinja allows you to create dynamic HTML templates by embedding Python-like expressions and logic directly into your HTML files. It supports variables, loops, conditionals, and more, making it a flexible tool for rendering content on the server side before it reaches the client.

## Template loading

In Invenio-based applications, Jinja templates are loaded from specific directories within your project structure.
By default, Flask, which powers Invenio, looks for template files in directories named `templates` located at the roots
of your ui modules (`<project-root>/ui/<module-name>/templates/`) or within individual Flask UI resource blueprints.

This directories should mirror the structure of your views, organizing
templates into subdirectories where applicable. Additionally, Invenio allows you to
[override default templates](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/customize/look-and-feel/templates/) provided
by Invenio modules or other extensions by placing custom templates in the corresponding paths within your templates
directory. Flask and Jinja automatically resolve these paths, ensuring that your application loads the correct template
files during rendering.

## Referencing templates

There will be cases when you need to reference a specific template file. This is often done when configuring views,
error pages, or when extending or including it in another templates.

This is done by providing a relative path following
the `templates` directory. For instance, if you have a template named `custom_error.html` located in
`ui/branding/templates/errors/`, you would reference it in your configuration as `"errors/custom_error.html"`. Flask's
Jinja template loader will automatically locate and load the template based on this path. By centralizing template references
in your configuration, you can easily swap or update templates without modifying the underlying code, promoting
flexibility and maintainability in your application.

## Basic syntax

### Variables

You can inject dynamic content into your templates using variables. Variables are enclosed in double curly braces `{{ }}`:

```python copy
<p>Hello, {{ user.name }}!</p>
```

This would render as:

```html
<p>Hello, John Doe!</p>
```
Assuming user.name is "John Doe".

### Filters
Filters allow you to modify variables in your templates. They are applied using the pipe | symbol:

```python copy
<p>{{ user.name | upper }}</p>
```
This would render the user’s name in uppercase:

```html
<p>JOHN DOE</p>
```

Control Structures
Jinja supports control structures like loops and conditionals to control the flow of rendering.

### Loops

Loops are used to iterate over lists or other iterable objects:

```python copy
<ul>
  {% for item in items %}
    <li>{{ item }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```
This would generate a list item for each element in items.

### Conditionals

Conditionals allow you to include logic in your templates:

```python copy
{% if user.is_admin %}
  <p>Welcome, admin!</p>
{% else %}
  <p>Welcome, user!</p>
{% endif %}
```
This renders different content based on the value of user.is_admin.

## Template inheritance

Jinja supports template inheritance, which allows you to define a base template and extend it in other templates. This promotes reuse and consistency across your application.

### Base template
Define a base template with common structure and blocks that can be overridden:

```html copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>{% block title %}My Application{% endblock %}</title>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>{% block header %}Welcome to My App{% endblock %}</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    {% block content %}{% endblock %}
  </main>
</body>
</html>
```

<Callout type="info">
Invenio provides a [base page](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-theme/blob/master/invenio_theme/templates/invenio_theme/page.html),
that gets inerited/extended by most of other Invenio page templates by default. You can change this base template by
pointing `BASE_TEMPLATE=invenio_theme/page.html` Invenio configuration option to your own file.
</Callout>

### Extending the base template
In your child templates, you can extend the base template and override specific blocks:

```jinja copy
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block title %}Home Page{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
  <p>This is the home page content.</p>
{% endblock %}
```

This child template will inherit the structure from base.html but replace the title and content blocks.

### Including templates

You can include other templates within a template, which is useful for reusing small pieces of code like navigation bars or footers:

```python copy
{% include "navbar.html" %}
```
This will include the content of navbar.html at the specified location.

## Macros

Macros allow you to define reusable pieces of code within your templates. They are similar to functions in Python:

```python copy
{% macro render_button(text, url) %}
  <a href="{{ url }}" class="btn">{{ text }}</a>
{% endmacro %}

<p>{{ render_button("Click Me", "https://example.com") }}</p>
```

This macro can be used to render buttons with different text and URLs throughout your application.

## Template context

When the Invenio server renders templates, it passes a context—a dictionary of variables—that Jinja uses as variables
o populate the template. In Invenio repository project, this typically happens in the UI resource views of the
corresponding UI modules.

To discover, which context variables are available to a template for a certain page/view,
you can typically look up the view methods under `<project-root>/ui/<module-name>/__init__.py` file
(look for methods declared on classes inheriting from `UIResource`). For example:

```python copy
from flask import render_template

class RecordResource(UIResource):
    # ...
    def detail():
        record = {"title": "Cool record", "metadata": {"author": "Doe, John"}}
        return render_template('record/detail.html', record=record)
```
In this example, the record dictionary is passed to `detail.html` and can be accessed as `record` variable within the template.

## Testing

    TODO: document how to unit-test complex Jinja templates & macros rendering. Can/should it be covered by pytest?
</Callout>

## Best practices

1. ***Keep logic out of templates***:
Avoid putting complex logic in your templates. Keep your templates focused on presentation and handle business logic in your view functions or models.

2. ***Use template inheritance***:
Leverage template inheritance to avoid duplication and ensure consistency across your application.

3. ***Organize your templates***:
Organize your templates in a way that makes sense for your project, using subdirectories if necessary to group related templates.

4. ***Use macros for reusable chunks of HTML***:
Define macros for commonly used simple chunks of HTML, not needing any complex attributes to be passed (for more complex scenarios,
[JinjaX](jinjax) might be a better fit).

## Conclusion

Jinja is a powerful tool for rendering dynamic content in your Invenio-based applications. By mastering its syntax and features, you can create flexible, maintainable templates that keep your front-end code organized and efficient. Explore further by integrating Jinja templates with other components in your application, like JinjaX and React, as detailed in subsequent sections of this documentation.
