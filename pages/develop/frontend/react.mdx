# React in our repositories

## Approach

As previously stated, our applications are multi page applications (MPA). Meaning, it is not a classical
React app, where you have one entry point and everything is rendered in the browser. Instead, we are using
Jinja/JinjaX for rendering the pages and React for rendering the interactive components.

This means that the front end is composed of many smaller react applications, which are mounted to different pages.
This has some advantages and some disadvantages. The main advantage is that
this inherently means that the react applications are smaller and therefore less complex and easier to develop.
The main disadvantage is that there is no such a thing as a global state, which can sometimes complicate things.




## Main UI components

In context of our repositories, main UI parts are the search page and the deposit form (and the detail page which is in jinja).
During the repository initial generation, after we create the model (./nrp model create model-name), basic React templates and
entry points for the search app and the form will be automatically generated for you (in the forms and search folders respectively).
We will discuss each of these individually in the following sections.
