# JinjaX components

JinjaX is a tool that allows you to write cleaner, more readable Jinja templates by transforming traditional Jinja
macros into easy-to-use components. This results in more maintainable and reusable code. This guide will show you how
to define and use JinjaX components in your Invenio-based application.

## What is a JinjaX component?

A JinjaX component is an abstraction over traditional Jinja macros that provides a more intuitive and declarative
syntax for reusable template elements. Instead of using Jinja's `{% macro %}` and `{% call %}` syntax, JinjaX allows
you to define components that can be invoked as if they were custom HTML tags.

Similar to React, every JinjaX component's name is expected to start with a capital letter.
Component's name corresponds directly to its filename.

## Converting Jinja macros to JinjaX components

### Traditional Jinja macros

Let's start with a traditional Jinja template that uses [macros](jinja#macros):

```python
{% extends "layout.html" %}
{% block title %}My title{% endblock %}

{% from "bunch_of_macros.html"
  import card_macro, another_macro %}

{% block content -%}
  <div>
    <h2>Hello {{ mystery or "World?" }}</h2>
    <div>
      {% call card_macro(title="So verbose") %}
        {% for product in products %}
          {{ another_macro(product) }}
        {% endfor %}
      {% endcall %}
    </div>
  </div>
  {% with items=products %}
    {% include "snippets/pagination.html" %}
  {% endwith %}
{%- endblock %}
```

### JinjaX component syntax
Here's how you would write the equivalent code using JinjaX components:

```jsx copy
{#def products, msg="World!" #}

<Layout title="My title">
  <div>
    <h2>Hello, {{ msg }}</h2>
    <div>
      <Card title="So clean">
        {% for product in products %}
          <Product :product="product" />
        {% endfor %}
      </Card>
    </div>
  </div>
  <Paginator :items="products" />
</Layout>
```

### Key differences
- **Syntax**: Instead of importing and calling macros, you define and use components directly in the template using a
syntax that resembles React. This approach is more declarative and easier to read.
- **Props (attributes)**: JinjaX allows you to pass variables to components as attributes (props), similar to how you
would pass props in React. For example, `<Card div="So clean">` passes the string "So clean" to the div prop of the Card component.
- **Self-closing tags**: Components that do not require content between their opening and closing tags can be self-closed
using `/>`, like `<Product :product="product" />`.
- **Declarative Layout**: By using components like `<Layout>` and `<Paginator>`, your template structure is more
aligned with the resulting HTML, making it easier to understand at a glance.
- **Multiple parent tags**: You can have more than one parent tag element in a component, unlike in React

## Creating JinjaX components

To create a JinjaX component, you define it using Jinja’s standard syntax but with the conventions used in JinjaX.
JinjaX components are easily distinguished from regular Jinja templates by using `.jinja` file extension.

Here’s an example of how you might define a Card component:

```jsx filename="templates/components/Card.jinja" copy
{#def title="So clean" #}
<div {{ attrs.render() }}>
  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  {{ content }}
</div>
```

When used in another template as:
```jsx
<Card title="Products" class="mb-10" open>bla</Card>
```

It will render into a HTML page as:
```html
<div class="mb-10" open>
  <h1>Products</h1>
  bla
</div>
```

## JinjaX components loading
JinjaX components typically don't need an explicit registration. For most of the pages (except a few Invenio core
internal pages where it can't be used - e.g. administration dashboard), it shares the
same [template discovery and loading mechanism](jinja#template-loading) as regular Jinja templates.

Once you place your component in one of templates folders, provided by a correct `.jinja` file extension,
you can right away start using the component in your templates and other components. There's no need to
import the component beforehand.

## Referencing JinjaX components

As you saw in the examples before, even the whole layouts or pages can be a JinjaX component.
To start using these for your UI route views, you need to refer to them from inside your UI ResourceConfig classes
`templates` attribute, similar to how you configure Jinja templates for each view. The key difference from Jinja here
is that path separator is `.` instead of `/` when referring to a JinjaX component:

```python copy
class MyViewResourceConfig(UIResourceConfig):
    template_folder = "templates"
    url_prefix = "/myview/"
    blueprint_name = "myview"

    templates = {
        "homepage": "myview.Homepage",
        "about": "myview.About",
    }
```

This configuration will try to look up your component files under the following paths:

```
<project-root>/ui/<module-name>/templates/myview/{About,Homepage}.jinja
```

## Best practices

1. **Keep Components Simple and Focused**
Components should encapsulate a single piece of functionality. This makes them easier to reuse and maintain.

2. **Use Descriptive Names**
Choose names for your components that clearly indicate their purpose, making it easier for others to understand what they do.

3. **Document Your Components**
Even though JinjaX components are simpler than traditional Jinja macros, adding comments or documentation within your components is still beneficial for future maintenance.

4. **Organize Your Components**
Store components in a well-organized directory structure. For example, you might have directories like components/forms/, components/layouts/, and components/widgets/.

5. **Declare all acceptable props**:
Declare all props that are acceptable by a component right at the component's `{# def #}` declaration.
When you try to pass anything else not declared here, it would cause an error.
