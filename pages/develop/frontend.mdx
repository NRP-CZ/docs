# Front-end development in Invenio

The following topics cover front-end development in Invenio Framework repository applications.
It  provides a comprehensive overview of how to build and maintain the front-end components of an Invenio-based
repository, covering everything from setting up your environment developing and integrating
custom pages and UI components into a repository site.

Invenio is based on the Flask Python micro framework and as such, it inherits and builds on much of front-end ecosystem from it.

## Intended audience

This guide is intended both for developers that needs to develop new features for their own NRP repository instance
and core NRP developers or anyone wanting to contribute to the project's front-end ecosystem.

## Frontend Architecture Overview

Our repositories follow a hybrid frontend architecture:

- **Record Detail Pages**: Built primarily with Jinja/JinjaX templates for server-side rendering
- **Interactive UI Components**: Implemented with React for rich, dynamic user experiences

This approach leverages the strengths of both technologies: server-rendered content for faster initial page loads and SEO benefits, combined with React's component-based architecture for complex interactive elements.

## Jinja/JinjaX for Record Detail Pages

Record detail pages are primarily rendered using Jinja/JinjaX templates. These templates:

- Are processed on the server side
- Receive data directly from the backend
- Generate HTML that is sent to the browser
- Provide excellent SEO capabilities
- Enable fast initial page loads

## React for Interactive UI Components

Most of our application's interactive UI is built with React, including:

- Search interfaces
- Form components
- Dashboard widgets
- Interactive data visualizations


## When to Use Which Technology

| Use Case                         | Technology   | Reasoning                               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Detail pages with static content | Jinja/JinjaX | SEO, fast initial load                  |
| Complex interactive elements     | React        | Component reuse, state management       |
| Forms                            | React        | Validation, dynamic fields              |
| Data visualization               | React        | Interactive charts, responsive displays |

## Design system

Our repositories are based on the Semantic UI design system. This means that all of the components that we use and also those that are coming from Invenio eco system
are also using Semantic UI. It is technically possible to use another design system, but it would require much more effort in terms of UI
development, therefore we recommend sticking with Semantic UI. Also all of the UI that your app is getting from our/Invenio source code
will be in Semantic UI, therefore, it will be difficult to achieve same look and feel accross the app if you
use different design system.

Semantic UI React is the official React integration for Semantic UI, available at [https://react.semantic-ui.com/](https://react.semantic-ui.com/).
For the static pages, you can use documentation of "regular" Semantic UI: https://semantic-ui.com/

## UI directory Structure

In our repositories, the UI section is organized as follows:

```
ui/model-name
├── theme-name
│   ├── js
│       └── model-name
│           ├── forms
│           │   ├── index.js
│           │   ├── FormActionsContainer.jsx
│           │   └── FormFieldsContainer.jsx
│           └── search
│               ├── index.js
│               ├── ResultsGridItem.jsx
│               └── ResultsListItem.jsx
├── templates
│   └── semantic-ui
│       └── model-name
│           ├── Deposit.jinja
│           ├── Detail.jinja
│           ├── Main.jinja
│           ├── Search.jinja
│           └── Sidebar.jinja
└── webpack.py

```

Note that you can have many folders under UI, and each one will have a similar structure. For example,
you will also have components folder that contains less components. 

The most important thing to note is that here you have your jinjax templates for the detail, search and form pages and your javascript files.
Plus the webpack.py file, which is very important as it serves to add new javascript entry points, javascript aliases and javascript dependencies to 
your project. It is basically a way to create your npm project via python.

Real example of UI folder for a project with model named documents:
