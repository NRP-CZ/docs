# Front-end development in Invenio

The following topics cover front-end development in Invenio Framework repository applications.
It  provides a comprehensive overview of how to build and maintain the front-end components of an Invenio-based
repository, covering everything from setting up your environment developing and integrating
custom pages and UI components into a repository site.

Invenio is based on the Flask Python micro framework and as such, it inherits and builds on much of front-end ecosystem from it.

## Intended audience

This guide is intended both for developers that needs to develop new features for their own NRP repository instance
and core NRP developers or anyone wanting to contribute to the project's front-end ecosystem.

## Table of Contents

### 1. Getting Started
Set up your development environment and start working on an Invenio site UI.
