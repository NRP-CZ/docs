# NRP Invenio repository python client

A python client library for accessing invenio-based repositories.

## Installation

```bash
pip install nrp-invenio-client
```

## Imports

Will use the following imports in the examples:

```python
from pprint import pprint
from nrp_invenio_client import NRPInvenioClient
```

## Instantiating the client

### Using config file

The client configuration file can be used to store parameters for repositories. The file is in YAML format and
is located in `~/.nrp/config.yaml` by default. The file can contain multiple repositories, each with its own
alias. The alias is used to select the repository to use. One of the repositories is a default repository, which
is used if no alias is specified.

To use the config file, you need to create it first. The easiest way is to use the `nrp` command line tool:

```bash
nrp add alias https://repo.du.cesnet.cz repo --default
```

This will create a config file with a repository with alias `repo` and default repository set to it.
It will also try to open your browser, let you log in and create and store an access token.

Then, in your python code you instantiate the client like this:

```python
client = NRPInvenioClient.from_config()

## or
client = NRPInvenioClient.from_config(alias="repo")
```

You can pass the location of the config file as well via the `config_file` argument.

*Note:* If `NRP_INVENIO_CLIENT_ABC` environent variable is set, it will be used instead of the value from the config file.
The ABC is uppercase version of the config key, e.g. `NRP_INVENIO_CLIENT_SERVER_URL` will be used instead of `server_url`
from the config file.

### Using parameters

To bypass the config file completely, you can instantiate the client with parameters:

```python
client = NRPInvenioClient(
    server_url     = "https://repo.du.cesnet.cz",
    token          = "api token",
    verify         = "/path/to/cert.pem",   # True by default, might be False to disable SSL verification
    retry_count    = 10,                    # idempotent requests will be retried 10 times
    retry_interval = 10,                    # retry interval in seconds if server is busy.
                                            # Exponential backoff is used from retry_interval - 10 * retry_interval
)
```

## Getting repository information

To get information about the invenio repository, we will use the `info` endpoint (/.well-known/info). Note that this endpoint
is NRP extension, it is not present in vanilla Invenio.

### General information

The general repository information is available at `/.well-known/info/repository` endpoint. Use the following code to get it:

```python
pprint(client.info.repository)

{
  "name": "NRP Invenio repository",
  "description": "NRP Invenio repository",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "invenio_version": "12.0.38",
  "links": {
    "self": "https://repo.du.cesnet.cz/api/info/repository",
    "models": "https://repo.du.cesnet.cz/api/info/models",
  },
  "features": [
    "drafts",
    "requests",
    "files"
  ],
  "transfers": [
    "local-file",
    "direct-s3",
    "url-fetch"
  ]
}
```

### Models

The repository can enumerate the models it supports, at the `/.well-known/info/models` endpoint. Use the following code to get it:

```python
pprint(client.info.models)

{
   "datasets": {
     "name": "Datasets",
     "description": "This model contains datasets.",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "features": [
       "drafts",
       "requests",
       "files",
       "custom_fields"
     ],
     "links": {
      "api": "https://myserver.cesnet.cz/api/datasets",
      "html": "https://myserver.cesnet.cz/datasets",
      "schema": "https://myserver.cesnet.cz/info/schemas/datasets-v1.0.0.json",
      "model": "https://myserver.cesnet.cz/info/models/datasets-v1.0.0.json",
      "openapi": "https://myserver.cesnet.cz/info/openapi/datasets-v1.0.0.json"
     }
   }
 }
```

## Searching within repository

### Searching vs. scanning

The client supports two modes of searching within
the repository: searching and scanning.

Searching is used when you want to have the results sorted by relevance
(or any other criteria). You will get only a limited number of records,
at most 10000. This limit can not be changed.

Scanning, on the other hand, gives you all records that match the query.
Scanning is more resource intensive than searching and server requires
you to be authenticated to use it.

### API principles

To initiate a search, you need to create a search request via `client.search` method:

```python
client = NRPInvenioClient.from_config()
request = client.search("datasets")
```

On the request, you can set various parameters, such as query, page, size, etc.

```python
## pagination - not used when scanning
request.page(2)

## pagination - not used when scanning
request.size(10)

## ordering - not used when scanning
request.order_by("+title", ...)

## select only specific records
request.published()
request.drafts()

## only return selected fields
request.fields("metadata.title", "metadata.description", ...)

## filter by query (either SOLR string or opensearch json)
request.query("metadata.title:foo")
```

### Using the search endpoint

Finally, you can execute the request:

```python
response = request.execute()
```

The response will contain the results of the search:

```python
print(response.total)
print(response.total_error)
for record in response:
    print(record)
```

### Using the scan endpoint

For scanning, you need to use the `scan` method instead of `request`:

```python
with request.scan() as response:
    for record in response:
        print(record)
```
