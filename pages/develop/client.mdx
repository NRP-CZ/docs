# NRP Invenio repository python client

A python library for accessing invenio-based repositories.

## Installation

```bash
pip install nrp-invenio-client
```

## Imports

Will use the following imports in the examples:

```python
from pprint import pprint
from nrp_invenio_client import NRPInvenioClient
```

## Instantiating the client

### Using config file

The client configuration file can be used to store parameters for repositories. The file is in YAML format and
is located in `~/.nrp/config.yaml` by default. The file can contain multiple repositories, each with its own
alias. The alias is used to select the repository to use. One of the repositories is a default repository, which
is used if no alias is specified.

To use the config file, you need to create it first. The easiest way is to use the `nrp` command line tool:

```bash
nrp add alias https://repo.du.cesnet.cz repo --default
```

This will create a config file with a repository with alias `repo` and default repository set to it.
It will also try to open your browser, let you log in and create and store an access token.

Then, in your python code you instantiate the client like this:

```python
client = NRPInvenioClient.from_config()

## or
client = NRPInvenioClient.from_config(alias="repo")
```

You can pass the location of the config file as well via the `config_file` argument.

*Note:* If `NRP_INVENIO_CLIENT_ABC` environent variable is set, it will be used instead of the value from the config file.
The ABC is uppercase version of the config key, e.g. `NRP_INVENIO_CLIENT_SERVER_URL` will be used instead of `server_url`
from the config file.

### Using parameters

To bypass the config file completely, you can instantiate the client with parameters:

```python
client = NRPInvenioClient(
    server_url     = "https://repo.du.cesnet.cz",
    token          = "api token",
    verify         = "/path/to/cert.pem",   # True by default, might be False to disable SSL verification
    retry_count    = 10,                    # idempotent requests will be retried 10 times
    retry_interval = 10,                    # retry interval in seconds if server is busy.
                                            # Exponential backoff is used from retry_interval - 10 * retry_interval
)
```

## Data structures

The responses from the server are represented as python objects, not as plain dictionaries.
To get the plain dictionary, call the `to_dict` method on the object.

## Getting repository information

To get information about the invenio repository, we will use the `info` endpoint (/.well-known/info). Note that this endpoint
is NRP extension, it is not present in vanilla Invenio.

### General information

The general repository information is available at `/.well-known/info/repository` endpoint. Use the following code to get it:

```python
pprint(client.info.repository.to_dict())

{
  "name": "NRP Invenio repository",
  "description": "NRP Invenio repository",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "invenio_version": "12.0.38",
  "links": {
    "self": "https://repo.du.cesnet.cz/api/info/repository",
    "models": "https://repo.du.cesnet.cz/api/info/models",
  },
  "features": [
    "drafts",
    "requests",
    "files"
  ],
  "transfers": [
    "local-file",
    "direct-s3",
    "url-fetch"
  ]
}
```

Properties on the NRPRepositoryInfo objects are: `name`, `description`, `version`, `invenio_version`,
`links`, `features`, `transfers` and contain exactly the same payload as in the example above.


### Models

The repository can enumerate the models it supports, at the `/.well-known/info/models` endpoint. Use the following code to get it:

```python
pprint(client.info.models.to_dict())

{
   "datasets": {
     "name": "Datasets",
     "description": "This model contains datasets.",
     "schemas": ["local://documents-1.0.0", "local://documents-2.0.0"],
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "features": [
       "drafts",
       "requests",
       "files",
       "custom_fields"
     ],
     "links": {
      "api": "https://myserver.cesnet.cz/api/datasets",
      "html": "https://myserver.cesnet.cz/datasets",
      "user": "https://myserver.cesnet.cz/api/user/datasets",
      "published":  "https://myserver.cesnet.cz/api/datasets",
      "drafts": "https://myserver.cesnet.cz/api/drafts/datasets",
      "schema": "https://myserver.cesnet.cz/info/schemas/datasets-v1.0.0.json",
      "model": "https://myserver.cesnet.cz/info/models/datasets-v1.0.0.json",
      "openapi": "https://myserver.cesnet.cz/info/openapi/datasets-v1.0.0.json"
     }
   }
 }
```

Properties on the NRPModelInfo objects are: `name`, `description`, ``schemas`,
`version`, `features`, `links` and contain exactly the same payload as in the example above.
Additionally, the `url` property is available, which contains `links.api` and `user_url`
containing the `links.user` endpoint (the exact values of the links are just examples, user should not
rely on their exact structure).

## Searching within repository

### Searching vs. scanning

The client supports two modes of searching within
the repository: searching and scanning.

Searching is used when you want to have the results sorted by relevance
(or any other criteria). You will get only a limited number of records,
at most 10000. This limit can not be changed.

Scanning, on the other hand, gives you all records that match the query.
Scanning is more resource intensive than searching and server requires
you to be authenticated to use it.

### API principles

To initiate a search, you need to create a search request via `client.search` method:

```python
client = NRPInvenioClient.from_config()
request = client.search("datasets")
```

On the request, you can set various parameters, such as query, page, size, etc.

```python
## pagination - not used when scanning
request.page(2)

## pagination - not used when scanning
request.size(10)

## ordering - not used when scanning
request.order_by("+title", ...)

## select only specific records
request.published()
request.drafts()

## only return selected fields
request.fields("metadata.title", "metadata.description", ...)

## filter by query (either SOLR string or opensearch json)
request.query("metadata.title:foo")
```

### Using the search endpoint

Finally, execute the request:

```python
response = request.execute()
```

The response will contain the results of the search:

```python
print(response.total)
print(response.total_error)
for record in response:
    print(record.to_dict())
```

The records returned from the iterator are instances of `NRPRecord` class.

### Using the scan endpoint

For scanning, you need to use the `scan` method instead of `request`:

```python
with request.scan() as response:
    for record in response:
        print(record)
```

## Record operations

### Getting a record from the repository

To get a record from the repository, you need to know its:

* model-aware id
* model and id within the model
* doi
* API url
* HTML url

#### Getting a record by model-aware id

```python
client = NRPInvenioClient.from_config()
rec: NRPRecord = client.records.get("datasets/1234", include_files=True, include_requests=True)
```

#### Getting a record by model and id within the model

```python
client = NRPInvenioClient.from_config()
model_id = "datasets"
record_id = "1234"
rec: NRPRecord = client.records.get_by_id(f"{model_id}/{record_id}", include_files=True, include_requests=True)
```

#### Getting a record by DOI or urls

```python
from nrp_invenio_client.config import NRPConfig
from nrp_invenio_client.records import record_getter

config = NRPConfig()
rec = record_getter(config, record_doi_or_url, include_files, include_requests)
```

**Note:** The `record_getter` function is a helper function that can be used to get a record by any identifier,
including mid, doi, api url and html url. For the `mid`, you can pass a `client` object that will be used
instead of the config's default repository client.

### Creating a record

To create a record, call the `create` method on the `records` object:

```python
client = NRPInvenioClient.from_config()
rec = client.records.create("datasets", {"title": "My dataset"})
```

The first argument is the name of the model to create the record in, the second argument is the
metadata of the record. The method returns the created record (an instance of `NRPRecord` class).

**Note:** If the model supports draft records, this call will create a draft record and the
`mid` on the record class will be in the form of `draft/model/id`.

### Updating a record

To update a record, you might call the `save` method on the record object:

```python
client = NRPInvenioClient.from_config()
rec = client.records.get("draft/datasets/1234")
rec.metadata["title"] = "My dataset"
rec.save()
```

This will ensure that optimistic locking is used when updating the record.

**Note:** For draft-enabled models you can update only draft records.

### Deleting a record

To delete a record, call the `delete` method on the `record` object:

```python
client = NRPInvenioClient.from_config()
rec = client.records.get("draft/datasets/1234")
rec.delete()
```

**Note:** For draft-enabled models you can delete only draft records.

## Publish and edit published records

### Publishing a record

To publish a record, call the `publish` method on the `record` object:

```python
client = NRPInvenioClient.from_config()
rec = client.records.get("draft/datasets/1234")
rec.publish(version="v1")
```

You can optionally specify the "human-readable" version of the record to publish.

### Editing a published record

To edit a published record, you need to create a new draft record at first. To do so,
call the `edit` method on the published `record` object:

```python
client = NRPInvenioClient.from_config()
rec = client.records.get("datasets/1234")
draft = rec.edit()
```

The `draft` object is a new draft record, which is a copy of the published record.
After you make the changes, you can save the draft record and publish it.

## Files

### Downloading record files

To download files from a record, you need at first get the record with files included:

```python
client = NRPInvenioClient.from_config()
rec = client.records.get("datasets/1234", include_files=True)
```

With this option, there is a `files` property on the record object,
which is a collection (class `NRPRecordFiles`) of `NRPFile` objects.
To download the file, call the `download` method on the file object:

```python
for fo in rec.files:
    fo.download("/path/to/downloaded/file")
```

**Note:** The current implementation of the `download` method uses a single thread download, which might be slow.
If you need to download multiple files, you might want to use a tool for a parallel download, such as `aria2c`, `axel` or `hget`. To use it,
get the `fo.content` url and download the file using a tool of your choice.


If you do not want to save the file but just get the content, you can call the open method:

```python
for fo in rec.files:
    with fo.open() as f:
        print(f.read()) # do whatever here
```

**Note:** The `open` method returns a file-like object, which is a `requests.Response` object.

### Uploading record files

To upload a file to a record, you need to get the record first:

```python
client = NRPInvenioClient.from_config()
rec = client.records.get("datasets/1234", include_files=True)
```

Then, you can upload the file:

```python
with open("filename.txt", "rb") as stream:
    rec.files.create("filename.txt", {"description": "My file"}, stream)
```

The first argument is the name of the file, the second argument is the metadata of the file and the third argument is the file stream
that needs to be open in binary mode.

**Note:** The implementation may use chunked upload if the server supports it. A prerequisite for a chunked upload
is that the opened stream supports the `seek` method and is able to tell its length.

### Updating file metadata for record files

To update the metadata of a file, you need to get the record first:

```python
client = NRPInvenioClient.from_config()
rec = client.records.get("datasets/1234", include_files=True)
```

Then, you can update the file metadata:

```python
file = rec.files.get("filename.txt")
file.metadata["description"] = "My updated file"
file.save()
```

### Replacing file content

To replace the content of a file, you need to get the record first:

```python
client = NRPInvenioClient.from_config()
rec = client.records.get("datasets/1234", include_files=True)
```

Then, you can replace the file content:

```python
file = rec.files.get("filename.txt")
with open("filename.txt", "rb") as stream:
    file.replace(stream)
```

### Deleting record files

To delete a file from a record, you need to get the record first:

```python
client = NRPInvenioClient.from_config()
rec = client.records.get("datasets/1234", include_files=True)
```

Then, you can delete the file:

```python
file = rec.files.get("filename.txt")
file.delete()
```
