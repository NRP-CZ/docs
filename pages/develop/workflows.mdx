## Permissions

The permissions are standard Invenio RDM permissions with a couple of added features:

1. `record` or `data` are always passed to permissions, allowing you to write your own generator
   that utilizes those. This can be used to require elevated permissions when a user tries to
   modify parts of the metadata.

2. As the record is always created within a community (and the community has an assigned default
   workflow), you only need to create permissions inside the workflows. There is no need to modify
   the global permissions.

3. Permissions for search results (`query_filter`) are always evaluated for all available workflows.
   The following query is created:

   ```
   query = (
       (parent.workflow == 'A') && (A.can_read.query_filter) 
    || (parent.workflow == 'B') && (B.can_read.query_filter)
    || (parent.workflow == 'C') && (C.can_read.query_filter)
    || ...
   )
   ```

### How it is implemented

The implementation uses standard RDM permissions but replaces the record's permission policy with
[WorkflowRecordPermissionPolicy](https://github.com/oarepo/oarepo-workflows/blob/main/oarepo_workflows/services/permissions/record_permission_policy.py#L25).

For each `can_...` property, this policy uses a specialized
[FromRecordWorkflow](https://github.com/oarepo/oarepo-workflows/blob/main/oarepo_workflows/services/permissions/generators.py#L38)
generator:

```python
class WorkflowRecordPermissionPolicy(RecordPermissionPolicy):
    """Permission policy to be used in permission presets directly on 
    RecordServiceConfig.permission_policy_cls.

    Do not use this class in the Workflow constructor.
    """

    can_commit_files = [FromRecordWorkflow("commit_files")]
    can_create = [FromRecordWorkflow("create")]
```

The `FromRecordWorkflow` generator inspects the passed `record` or `data`, extracts the workflow ID
from those, loads the workflow from the configuration, and calls the appropriate `can_...` method
on the workflow.

### SameAs

Suppose you want to express that `can_update_files` is the same as `can_update`, meaning if a user
has permission to update the record, they can also update the files.

One possible implementation is:

```python
class MyPermissionPolicy(...):
    can_update = [...]
    can_update_files = can_update
```

This will work unless you'd like to inherit from your policy and change the `can_update`. This will
break:

```python
class MySecondPermissionPolicy(MyPermissionPolicy):
    can_update = [... new definition ...]
    # expecting that can_update_files 
    # is also the new definition, but it is pointing
    # to the old one
```

For cases like these, you can use `SameAs`:

```python
class MyPermissionPolicy(...):
    can_update = [...]
    can_update_files = SameAs("can_update")
```

This guarantees that even if you override `can_update` in a subclass, the `can_update_files` will
always use the latest definition.

## Requests

In NRP Invenio, requests are first-class citizens. There is an API to create new requests regardless
of their type. A new URL, `/api/<records>/<recid>/requests/applicable`, has been added to all records
and provides a list of requests that can be created at the moment.

Only the request types that inherit from the
[OARepoRequestType](https://github.com/oarepo/oarepo-requests/blob/main/oarepo_requests/types/generic.py#L47C7)
are serialized to this list.

### Applicable request types

A request type has an
[is_applicable_to(identity, topic, ...)](https://github.com/oarepo/oarepo-requests/blob/main/oarepo_requests/types/generic.py#L110)
method that returns `True` if the request can potentially be created for the topic. The base
implementation takes the permission policy from the request's service to check if the identity has
create rights. In most cases, the permission policy is replaced with
[CreatorsFromWorkflowRequestsPermissionPolicy](https://github.com/oarepo/oarepo-workflows/blob/main/oarepo_workflows/requests/permissions.py#L26),
which delegates the creation to the topic's workflow:

```python
    can_create = [
        SystemProcess(),
        RequestCreatorsFromWorkflow(),
    ]
```

The `RequestCreatorsFromWorkflow`:

1. Gets the workflow for the passed topic.
2. Gets the `requests` portion of the workflow and looks up the request type. If it is not there,
   it returns `False`.
3. Calls `.needs()` for requesters and performs an intersection with the identity's provides.

**Example:**

```python
class DefaultWorkflowRequests(WorkflowRequestPolicy):
    publish_draft = WorkflowRequest(
        requesters=[
            RecordOwners(),
        ],
        recipients=[PrimaryCommunityRole("curator")],
        transitions=...,
        escalations=...,
    )
```

In the example above, `RecordOwners` creates a `UserNeed(id=topic.parent.access.owned_by)`.

#### Applicable request types serialization

The serialization is a REST list with a hit containing:

```json
[
 {
  "type_id": "delete_published_record",
  "links": {
   "actions": {
    "create": "https://docs.test.du.cesnet.cz/api/docs/f7cak-7b568/requests/delete_published_record"
   }
  },
  "description": "Request deletion of published record",
  "name": "Delete record",
  "dangerous": true,
  "editable": false,
  "has_form": true,
  "stateful_name": "Delete record",
  "stateful_description": "Click to permanently delete the record."
 }
]
```

### Creating a new request

To create a new request, call `POST` on the `create` URL. The payload is the Invenio serialization
of a request, **excluding** the `topic` and `receiver`. The `topic` is filled in automatically from
the record on the path. To get the receiver,
`current_oarepo_requests.default_request_receiver(identity, type_, topic, creator or identity, data)`
is called. This call normally goes to `oarepo_workflows` where:

1. The workflow is taken from the topic.
2. The configuration of the request is extracted from the workflow.
3. The `recipients=[PrimaryCommunityRole("curator")]` is taken.
4. `PrimaryCommunityRole` inherits from
   [RecipientGeneratorMixin](https://github.com/oarepo/oarepo-workflows/blob/main/oarepo_workflows/requests/generators/recipient_generator.py),
   which implements:

   ```python
   def reference_receivers(
           self, 
           record: Optional[Record] = None, 
           request_type: Optional[RequestType] = None, 
           **context: Any) -> list[dict[str, str]]
   ```

5. Each element of the recipients list returns 0+ entity references, and all are combined into a
   single sent reference.
6. If the result is a single entity reference, it is used as is.
7. **[hack]** If the result contains multiple references (e.g., the request can be approved by a
   curator or community owner), a special `{"multiple": json.dumps(references)}` entity reference is
   generated. This is necessary because Invenio allows only a single entity reference in the receiver.

Then, the normal create request is calledâ€”permissions are checked, and so on.

### Displaying requests/request types - buttons

A request type has
[stateful_name()](https://github.com/oarepo/oarepo-requests/blob/main/oarepo_requests/types/generic.py#L143)
and
[stateful_description()](https://github.com/oarepo/oarepo-requests/blob/main/oarepo_requests/types/generic.py#L159)
methods responsible for getting contextualized UI representations of the request type/request. These
are used as button labels inside the UI.

```python
    def stateful_name(
        self,
        identity: Identity,
        *,
        topic: Record,
        request: Request | None = None,
        **kwargs: Any,
    ) -> str | LazyString:
        """Return the name of the request that reflects its current state.

        :param identity:        identity of the caller
        :param request:         the request
        :param topic:           resolved request's topic
        """
        return self.name

    def stateful_description(
        self,
        identity: Identity,
        *,
        topic: Record,
        request: Request | None = None,
        **kwargs: Any,
    ) -> str | LazyString:
        """Return the description of the request that reflects its current state.

        :param identity:        identity of the caller
        :param request:         the request
        :param topic:           resolved request's topic
        """
        return self.description
```

This way, the UI can show different labels for request types, submitted requests, and approved/declined
requests. Also, the request type can return `dangerous: true` to signal that the request will perform
a potentially dangerous operation (such as a `delete_published_record` request). These will be displayed
in a different color and will require an additional confirmation step when approved.

### Request form

A request can have a form associated with it, serialized to the payload of the request. An example is
a delete record request, where the user must fill in the reason for removal.

[See delete published request](https://github.com/oarepo/oarepo-requests/blob/main/oarepo_requests/types/delete_published_record.py#L37)
for details:

```python
    payload_schema = {
        "removal_reason": ma.fields.Str(),
        "note": ma.fields.Str()
    }

    form = [
        {
            'section': "",
            "fields": [
                {
                    "field": "removal_reason",
                    "ui_widget": "Input",
                    "props": {
                        "label": _("Removal Reason"),
                        "placeholder": _("Write down the removal reason."),
                        "required": True,
                    },
                },
                {
                    "section": "",
                    "field": "note",
                    "ui_widget": "Input",
                    "props": {
                        "label": _("Note"),
                        "placeholder": _("Write down the additional note."),
                        "required": False,
                    },
                }, 
            ]
        }
    ]
```

This part uses the same form approach as the one used in custom fields on the record
or fields on `invenio-administration` forms.

### Escalation

Escalation is evaluated automatically by the system each night. You can trigger it manually
by invoking `invenio oarepo requests escalate` command. This will check all requests and
escalate those that are overdue. The escalation is done by replacing the recipient of the
request with the new recipient from the workflow. The previous and new recipients are saved
within the 'E' event associated with the request.

### Events

Events can be used to associate "history" events with the request. Events can be
either created by the system (such as the escalation event above) or by the user.
All possible events are defined in the `DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_EVENTS` constant:

```python

DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_EVENTS = {
    CommentEventType.type_id: WorkflowEvent(
        submitters=InvenioRequestsPermissionPolicy.can_create_comment
    ),
    LogEventType.type_id: WorkflowEvent(
        submitters=InvenioRequestsPermissionPolicy.can_create_comment
    ),
    TopicUpdateEventType.type_id: WorkflowEvent(
        submitters=InvenioRequestsPermissionPolicy.can_create_comment
    ),
    EscalationEventType.type_id : WorkflowEvent(
        submitters=InvenioRequestsPermissionPolicy.can_create_comment
    ),
    RecordSnapshotEventType.type_id: WorkflowEvent(
        submitters=InvenioRequestsPermissionPolicy.can_create_comment
    )
}
```
