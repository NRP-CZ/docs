# External authority provider <Difficulty level="intermediate" />

An External Authority Provider is a component for integrating custom external authorities with Invenio.
By developing an external authority provider, you can seamlessly incorporate vocabulary-compatible records
from external sources such as Research Organization Registry (ROR) or Digital Object Identifier (DOI) system into
Invenio. This integration enables Invenio to leverage authoritative and standardized data from these external sources,
ensuring consistency, accuracy, and interoperability within your digital repository.

This documentation will guide you through the process of creating
and configuring an external authority provider, detailing the necessary steps and considerations for successful
integration.

## Prerequisites

The following documentation assumes the reader has a decent knowledge of Python & REST APIs.

## Provider class

To implement a custom authority provider, you will need to create your provider class,
implementing alteast the methods from the `AuthorityProvider` base class, for example:

```python
class MyProvider(AuthorityProvider):
    def search(self, identity, params, **kwargs):
        """
        Search the external authority service by the given text query and return
        a tuple: ```(items, total?, page_size?)```
        """

        # TODO: do any necessary network requests to the authority APIs here
        results = my_external_api.search(params)

        # TODO: transform result items to vocabulary format
        items = [to_vocabulary_item(item) for item in results]

        return items, 2, 10

    def get(self, identity, item_id, *, uow, value, **kwargs):
        """
        Gets vocabulary item by id. Returns the item as JSON or KeyError if the item could not be found.
        @param item_id  value['id']
        @param uow      actual unit of work (if you need to create something inside the db, do it inside this uow)
        @param value    the value passed from the client
        """

        # TODO: do any necessary network requests to the authority APIs here
        result = my_external_api.get(item_id)

        # TODO: transform result to vocabulary format
        return to_vocabulary_item(result)
```

Note that the `AuhtorityProvider` class is responsible from contacting the external authority APIs, and
converting returned records to vocabulary record format of:

```json
{
            "id": "my_id_type:recordid123",
            "title": "My external record",
            "tags": ["...", ...],
            "props": {
                # prop values must be strings
            },
            # NOTE: This attribute requires RelatedURICF Vocabulary custom field enabled.
            "relatedURI": {"my_id_type": "https://myexternalauthority/recordid123"}
}
```
