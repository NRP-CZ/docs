# NRP commandline tools


<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  NRP commandline tools can currently be used only for NRP repositories
  based on Invenio technology stack. They can not be used to access
  repositories based on other technology stacks, such as DSpace,
  ARL or Islandora.
</Callout>


## Prerequisites

- python 3.10 or higher
- curl

## Installation

### Binary distribution for Linux/64bit

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Not yet released, use the pip version instead.
</Callout>

Download the latest release from [github](tbd) and place it somewhere to your PATH.
Then just run the `nrp-cli`.

### Using pip and virtualenv

Run the following command to install the tool:

```bash
python3 -m venv nrp-invenio-client
source nrp-invenio-client/bin/activate
pip install nrp-invenio-client
```

For better comfort, create an alias in your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` file:

```bash
alias nrp-cli="<path-to-nrp-invenio-client>/bin/nrp-cli"
```

Create a new terminal and try running `nrp-cli`.

## Managing repositories

### Adding a repository alias

The tool can work with multiple repositories. Each repository is
identified by an alias and one of the repositories is set as a default.

To add a repository, invoke:

```bash
nrp-cli add alias <servername> <alias> [--token token] [--skip-token] [--default]
```

where the `servername` is either the full URL of the server, or just the
name of the host (e.g. `myserver.cesnet.cz`) and alias is an optional alias.
If you do not provide the alias, the first part of the servername (up to the first dot)
will be used.

If you do not specify the token, the command will try to open a repository login page
in your default browser. After you log in, the command will finish automatically
and store the token in the file.

### Selecting the default repository

A default repository is used when no repository alias is specified in the command.
The first repository added will be set as default. To change the default repository,
run:

```bash
nrp-cli select repository <alias>
```

### Removing a repository

To remove a repository, run:

```bash
nrp-cli remove repository <alias>
```

The list of repositories is stored in `~/.nrp/repositories.yaml` file.

The file has the following structure:

```yaml
alias1:
  url: <url>
  token: <token>
  default: true
alias2:
  url: <url>
  token: <token>
  default: false
```

### Selecting repository for a single command

The repository on which operations will be performed
might be selected in different ways:

1. If nothing is specified, the default repository is used.
2. If the `--alias` option is used, the repository with the given alias is used.
3. If the `--repository-url` option is used, the repository with the given URL is used.
You can also specify the token using the `--token` option,
`--retries` to specify the number of retries in case of a failure,
and `--retry-interval` to specify the interval between retries.

## Repository introspection

### Basic information

To get information about the repository, invoke:

```bash
nrp-cli describe repository [--format=table,json,yaml] <alias>
```

This command will return a basic information about the repository, such as
name and description.

You can select a format of the output using the `--format` option.

Sample YAML output:

```yaml
name: Molecular bioinformatics repository
description: This repository contains molecular bioinformatics data.
features:
- drafts
- communities
- requests
- custom_fields
transfers:
- local-file
- url-fetch
version: 1.0.0
invenio_version: 12.0.13
```

Sample table output (default):

```
name           version    invenio_version    features       transfers    description
-------------  ---------  -----------------  -------------  -----------  -----------------------------
API test repo  1.0.0      12.0.13            drafts         local-file   Description of the repository
                                             communities    url-fetch
                                             requests
                                             custom_fields
```

### Models

To get information about the models in the repository, invoke:

```bash
nrp-cli describe models [--format=table,json,yaml] <alias> <model-regex>
```

Sample YAML output:

```yaml
models:
  datasets:
    name: Datasets
    description: This model contains datasets.
    version: 1.0.0
    features:
      - requests
      - drafts
      - files
      - custom_fields
    links:
      api: https://myserver.cesnet.cz/api/datasets
      html: https://myserver.cesnet.cz/datasets
      schema: https://myserver.cesnet.cz/jsonschema/datasets-v1.0.0.json
      openapi: https://myserver.cesnet.cz/openapi/datasets-v1.0.0.json
    custom_fields:
      - name: myfield
        label: My field
        description: This is my field.
        type: string
  another_model:
    name: Another model
    description: This is another model.
    version: 1.5.0
    features:
      - requests
      - drafts
      - files
    links:
      api: https://myserver.cesnet.cz/api/another_model
      html: https://myserver.cesnet.cz/another_model
      schema: https://myserver.cesnet.cz/jsonschema/another_model-v1.0.0.json
      openapi: https://myserver.cesnet.cz/openapi/another_model-v1.0.0.json
```

## Searching the repository


To search the repository, invoke one of the following commands:

```bash
nrp-cli search records [modifiers] <query>
nrp-cli list records [modifiers] <query>
```

The optional query is a query string in the OpenSearch format. For example:

```bash
nrp-cli search records "title:mytitle"
```

### Modifiers

The following modifiers are supported:

* `--model` - name of the model which will be searched.
If not specified, all models will be searched. This option can be specified multiple times.
* TODO `--community` - name of the community whose records will be searched.
If not specified, all communities will be searched. This option can be specified multiple times.
* TODO `--collection` - name of the collection whose records will be searched.
If not specified, all collections will be searched. This option can be specified multiple times.
* `--size` - number of results to return. Default is 10.
* `--page` - page number to return. Default is 1.
* `--all-records` - if specified, all records will be returned.
This will override the `--size` and `--page` modifiers.
You need to be authenticated to use this option.
* `--sort` - sort order. The format is `<field>:<order>`, where `<field>` is the
name of the field to sort by and `<order>` is either `asc` or `desc`.
The default order is `asc`. This option can be specified multiple times.
* `--drafts` - if specified, only draft records will be returned.
* `--published` - if specified, only published records will be returned.
* `--format <format>` - format of the output. The default is `yaml`.
The supported formats are `json` and `yaml`.

If multiple models, communities or collections are specified, the search will return results
from all of them in undefined order.

If the user is logged in, the search will also return private records.

### Output

If `--all-records` option is not used, the output looks like:

```yaml
hits:
- mid: datasets/1
  id: 1
  links:
    self: https://myserver.cesnet.cz/api/datasets/1
    self_html: https://myserver.cesnet.cz/datasets/1
  metadata:
    title: My dataset
- mid: datasets/2
  id: 2
  ...
total: 100
links:
  self: ...
  next: ...
  prev: ...
```

The records will be output in the order they were returned from the server as soon as
they are received. The `id` is the identifier within the model, `mid` is the identifier
including the model, which can be used in subsequent calls

#### Pagination

If `--all-records` are not used, only a single page of results will be returned.
To get the next page, run the command with `--page` option. For example:

```bash
nrp-cli search --page 2 myserver "title:mytitle"
```

Note that records might be repeated on different pages or some of the records can be skipped.
To prevent this, run the command with `--all-records` option.


## Record identifiers

Several representations can be used to identify a record:

* `model/id` - this is the `mid` field from search hits.
* `draft/model/id` - this is the `mid` field from search hits for drafts.
* `https://repository/api/model/id` - the `self` url of the record
* `https://repository/api/user/model/id` - the `self` url of the draft record
* `https://repository/model-ui/id` - the `self_html` url of the record. The HTML page
must contain api metadata inside the head tag.
* `doi:10.3323/1234567` - a DOI allocated by the repository
(or any other supported external persistent identifier).
The DOI must be resolvable. A call to the DOI resolver will be made to get
the actual location of the record metadata.

## Getting record

To get record metadata, invoke

```bash
nrp-cli get record <pid>
```

The command will output the record to stdout, for example in yaml:

```yaml
id: 1
mid: datasets/1
links:
  self: https://myserver.cesnet.cz/api/datasets/1
  self_html: https://myserver.cesnet.cz/datasets/1
metadata:
  title: My dataset
```

You can specify additional parameters:

* `-o`, `--output-file fn` - will save the record as this output file
* `--files` - will add a list of files to the output
* `--requests` - will add a list of requests to the output
* `--format` - will change the output format to `json` or `yaml`
* `--overwrite` - will overwrite the output file if it already exists,
otherwise an error will be raised

The value of the `--output-file` can contain placeholders `{model}` and `{id}` which
will be replaced with the model name and the record id. The placeholders can also
reference metadata from within the record, such as `{metadata.title}.json`.
Subdirectories are allowed within the `--output-file` and will be created if necessary.
