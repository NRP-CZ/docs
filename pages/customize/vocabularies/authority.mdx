# External authority provider

For cases when autosuggestions and addition of items to a specific vocabulary from some external authority
source is needed, configure the `authority` provider field in your `INVENIO_VOCABULARY_TYPE_METADATA` for
a specific vocabulary.

For example, the following will allow suggestion of additional institutions from external ROR authority provider:

```python filename="invenio.cfg" copy
from oarepo_vocabularies.authorities import RORProviderV2

INVENIO_VOCABULARY_TYPE_METADATA = {
    "institutions-backed-by-ror": {
        "name": {"cs": "Instituce", "en": "Institutions"},
        "authority": RORProviderV2,
        "props": {
            ...
        },
    },
```

Additionally, make sure you have enabled the `AuthorityComponent` on your record model, e.g.:

```yaml filename="model.yaml"
record:
  # ...
  service-config:
    components:
      - "{{oarepo_vocabularies.authorities.components.AuthorityComponent}}"
      # - ...
```

If that's not the case, add it and [recompile your model](/develop/model/compile).

When some custom authority provider not bundled as part of the `oarepo-vocabularies` library is needed, follow
the [External Authority provider development](/develop/authority) guide on how to create one.
