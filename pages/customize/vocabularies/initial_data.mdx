# Initial data for vocabularies <Difficulty level="easy" />

To import initial data into vocabularies, create a fixture and call importing the fixture.

## Fixture catalogue file

The vocabularies that will be imported are defined in a fixture catalogue file. The file is located at
`fixtures/catalogue.yaml` and contains a list of vocabularies to be imported.

```yaml
Colors:
- source: files/Colors.yaml
- writer: vocabulary
  vocabulary: Colors
  pid_type: v-colo
  title:
    cs: Barvy a optické vlastnosti
    en: Colors and Optical Properties
```

The `Colors:` defines the name of the item inside the catalogue.yaml (can be used for overriding the default fixture - see below).

The next line specifies, that the vocabulary content will be loaded from the file `files/Colors.yaml`. The `writer` line
defines that the content of the file will be vocabulary records and thus the vocabulary service will be used.
Then you need to define the target vocabulary (Colors in this case, must be unique) and pid type
(up to 6 characters, must be unique). The last line defines the title of the vocabulary in different languages.

## Vocabulary file

Vocabulary file is a YAML multi-documents file containing the vocabulary records. The file is located at `fixtures/files/Colors.yaml`.

```yaml
id: blue
title:
  en: Blue
  cs: Modrá
---
id: red
title:
  en: Red
  cs: Červená
```

Each document in the file represents a single vocabulary record. The first line specifies the record id, which must be unique
within the vocabulary. The last section specifies the title of the record in different languages. You might add text props,
keywords or custom fields here as well.
See [Invenio vocabularies schema](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-vocabularies/blob/master/invenio_vocabularies/records/jsonschemas/vocabularies/vocabulary-v1.0.0.json)
for more information.

**Note:** The vocabulary file must be a yaml, json or excel file. The yaml/json must have the structure as above,
if you use an excel file the structure is more complicated - see [Czech NR vocabularies](https://github.com/Narodni-repozitar/nr-vocabularies/tree/main/nr_vocabularies/fixtures)
for examples.

## Overriding the default fixture

If you use the nr-vocabularies package (installed by default if you use nr-data or nr-docs metadata model),
the required vocabularies have already been installed for you. In some cases you might want to override them.
To do so, change the following section inside pyproject.toml to:

```toml

[project.entry-points."oarepo.fixtures"]
100-uct-fixtures = "fixtures"
```

The added prefix `100-` will ensure that the fixture takes precedence.

Then, put your overrides to `fixtures/catalogue.yaml`:

```yaml
vocabulary-institutions:
  - source: ./institutions.yaml
  - writer: vocabulary
    vocabulary: institutions
    pid_type: v-i
    title:
      cs: Instituce
      en: Institutions
```
