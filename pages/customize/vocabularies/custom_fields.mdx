# Custom vocabulary fields  <Difficulty level="intermediate" />

Custom vocabulary fields can be used to add additional, non-text information to a vocabulary term.
For example, you might want to add integer fields, boolean fields, or even custom structured data to a vocabulary term.

If you want to add string fields, there is no need to create custom vocabulary fields. Just add the data to the `props`
section of the vocabulary term.

## Example

```yaml
# languages.yaml inside fixtures directory

id: english
title:
  en: English
  fr: Anglais
props:
  isoCode: en
```

## API configuration

The model is shared between all vocabulary types - so at the API level, there is no distinction between, for example,
languages, countries, or resource types. The model is the same for all of them.

That is why the custom fields are also shared between all vocabulary types. To define them, add the following section
to the `invenio.cfg` file:

```python
VOCABULARIES_CF = [
    BooleanCF("myorg:featured")
]
```

This will add a new custom field to all vocabularies. The `BooleanCF` class is used to define a custom field for
a boolean value. There are also other classes available, such as `IntegerCF`, `KeywordCF`, `DateCF`, etc., see the
[Records's custom fields](/customize/record/custom_fields) section for more information.
