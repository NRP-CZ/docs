# Editable vocabularies  <Difficulty level="intermediate" />

NRP Invenio repositories have support for editable vocabularies. To activate it, you need to:

* Specify the fields of each vocabulary type, that will be editable
* Create a permission policy, that will allow users to edit the vocabularies

## Specifying editable fields

To specify UI details for Invenio vocabularies, use the `INVENIO_VOCABULARY_TYPE_METADATA` configuration variable:

```python
# invenio.cfg

INVENIO_VOCABULARY_TYPE_METADATA = {
    "languages": {
        "name": {
            "cs": "Jazyky",
            "en": "Languages",
        },
        "description": {
            "cs": "Slovník obsahující definice světových jazyků.",
            "en": "Language definitions vocabulary.",
        },
        "props": {
            "alpha3CodeENG": {
                "description": _("ISO 639-2 standard 3-letter language code"),
                "icon": None,
                "label": _("Alpha3 code (English)"),
                "multiple": False,
                "placeholder": "eng, cze...",
                "search": False,
            },
            "alpha3CodeNative": {
                "description": _("ISO 639-2 standard 3-letter language code"),
                "icon": None,
                "label": _("Alpha3 code (native)"),
                "multiple": False,
                "options": [],
                "placeholder": "eng, ces...",
                "search": False,
            },
        },
        "dump_options": True,
    },
    # ...
}
```

The `name` and `description` fields are used for the human readable vocabulary type name and description.
The `props` field is a dictionary of editable string fields, that can be set on the vocabulary item.

*Note:* Custom fields (that is, non-string fields, such as booleans, structures or arrays) can be specified elsewhere
inside the `invenio.cfg`. See [Vocabulary custom fields](/customize/vocabularies/custom_fields.mdx) for more information.

If you specify `dump_options` to `True`, the vocabulary content will be stored within the editation form,
so that no API requests will need to be called to get the vocabulary content. This might yield to a better user experience
but should be used only for small vocabularies.

## Permission policy

To allow users to edit vocabularies, specify a permission policy with `VOCABULARIES_PERMISSIONS_PRESETS` setting.
The value of the setting is a list of permission policies, that will be used to check the permissions.
A user is granted an access if any of the policies allows it. The value in the list can be either a string
or a subclass of `RecordPermissionPolicy`.

```python
# invenio.cfg

app_config["VOCABULARIES_PERMISSIONS_PRESETS"] = ["authenticated"]
```

This will allow any authenticated user to edit vocabularies.

## Custom permissions

If you'd like to specify a custom permission policy (for example,
to allow only a group of users to edit vocabularies), you can create
your own permission policy class, register it with a custom name and
use it in the `VOCABULARIES_PERMISSIONS_PRESETS` setting.

This process is described in [Permissions](/customize/record/permissions.mdx).


## Fine-grained permissions

The disadvantage of the approach above is that it allows users to edit all the vocabularies.
If you want to limit the editing to only some vocabularies, you need to use the fine-grained permissions.

### Configuration

```python
# invenio.cfg

app_config["OAREPO_FINE_GRAINED_VOCABULARIES_PERMISSIONS"] = True

app_config["VOCABULARIES_PERMISSIONS_PRESETS"] = [FineGrainedPermissionPolicy]
```

The first line turns on the fine-grained permissions, the second sets the permission presets to the custom policy.

### Creating a fine-grained permission policy

Create a file `vocabularies_permissions.py` in your shared/common module with the following content:

```python
from oarepo_runtime.services.config.permissions_presets import EveryonePermissionPolicy

class FineGrainedPermissionPolicy(EveryonePermissionPolicy):
    can_create_languages = [SystemProcess(), AnyUser()]
    can_update_languages = [SystemProcess(), AnyUser()]
    can_delete_languages = [SystemProcess(), AnyUser()]
```

This will allow any user to create, update and delete vocabularies of type `languages`. You need to specify the
can_create, can_update and can_delete permissions for each vocabulary type you want to allow editing. All other
vocabularies will be read-only.

To allow just a group of people to edit the vocabularies, use the `UserWithRole` permission:

```python
from oarepo_runtime.services.config.permissions_presets import EveryonePermissionPolicy
from oarepo_runtime.services import UserWithRole

class FineGrainedPermissionPolicy(EveryonePermissionPolicy):
    can_create_languages = [SystemProcess(), UserWithRole("curator")]
```

**Implementation note:** The policy above is applied in two steps:

1. `can_XXXX_vocabulary` permission policy is checked. If it returns False, permission is denied.
2. Invenio checks the `can_XXXX` permission policy (the generic one). If it returns False, permission is denied.

That's why the base class above is EveryonePermissionPolicy. If you'd like to use a different base class
(such as ReadOnlyPermissionPolicy), you need to override the `can_XXXX` permission policy to the same value
as the `can_XXXX_vocabulary` policy.
