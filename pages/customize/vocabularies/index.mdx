# Vocabularies

NRP uses an extension of Invenio vocabularies, which are used to provide controlled vocabularies for metadata fields.
The controlled vocabularies are used to ensure consistency and quality of the metadata and are used in the record
deposition form, and in the record detail page.

Extensions to standard Invenio vocabularies include:

* **Editable vocabularies**: Allow people to create new vocabulary items.
* **Custom vocabulary fields**: Provide custom fields inside the definition of vocabulary items
* **Hierarchy in vocabularies**: Define a hierarchy between vocabulary items.

Vocabularies are referenced from metadata schemas and thus a new vocabulary can be created only
during the development/deployment of a new metadata schema. There are no tools to add and use
a new vocabulary during runtime.
