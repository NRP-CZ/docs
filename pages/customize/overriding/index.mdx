# UI component overriding overview


Overriding UI components is a powerful way to customize your application, without needing to modify the core codebase. This allows you to change the appearance and behavior of existing components, or create entirely new ones, while still benefiting from updates and improvements in the core application.
A lot of times, you will have UI elements that you just cannot modify, as they come from external sources.
