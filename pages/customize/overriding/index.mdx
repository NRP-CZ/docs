# UI component overriding overview


Overriding UI components is a powerful way to customize your application, without needing to modify the core codebase. This allows you to change the appearance and behavior of existing components, or create entirely new ones, while still benefiting from updates and improvements in the core application.
A lot of times, you will have UI elements that you just cannot modify, as they come from external sources.
This is where overriding comes in handy. 

As the front end is composed of a few different technologies, the overriding process is different for each of them.

Choose your overriding method:

- [Overriding HTML templates](/customize/overriding/html)
- [Overriding JinjaX components](/customize/overriding/jinjax) 
- [Overriding React components](/customize/overriding/react)
