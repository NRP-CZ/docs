# Overriding HTML Templates

Invenio application is based on Flask and is composed of many extensions. Some of these
extensions provide parts of UI. For example, when you install invenio-communities,
you will get entire UI for communities that lives in /communities section of the application.

As the rest of the app, this UI is a HTML page that can have arbitrary CSS and JS included. 
Overriding an entire HTML page is the largest customization you can do, but also it may 
require the most effort to implement and later maintain. It is usually best to try to reuse existing
UI if it is possible.

In Invenio, HTML template loading is prioritized based on the APP_THEME variable in invenio.cfg i.e.,
the first template found in the list will be used. This means that you can override any HTML template
by creating a new file with the same name in your repository's `templates` directory, using the theme name
with the greatest priority.

Default APP_THEME is:

```
APP_THEME = ["oarepo", "semantic-ui"]
```

This means that you can use oarepo templates to override any semantic-ui template.
For example, let us say that you want to override the HTML template
for communities [members](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-communities/blob/master/invenio_communities/templates/semantic-ui/invenio_communities/details/members/base.html).
You can do this by creating a new file in your repository's `templates` directory:

```
ui/your-model-name/templates/oarepo/invenio_communities/details/members/base.html
```

![ui folder structure](/images/overriding_html_templates.png)

It must have the same path as the original, but with the theme that has priority. In this case, we are using oarepo instead of semantic-ui.
Pay attention when creating the path as it is relatively easy to make a mistake in which case it will not work.

Example code you will put in this file:

```
{% extends "semantic-ui/invenio_communities/details/members/base.html" %}
{%- block settings_menu %}
{%- endblock settings_menu %}
```
This will remove the settings menu from the members page.

This method is very powerful, meaning you can provide your own HTML and static assets and in that way
you can entirely change a page that comes from an external source.
