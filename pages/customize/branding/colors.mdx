Setting a brand color affects the primary color tone of your repository site,
other important UI elements either directly use this color or derive its appearance from it.

```less filename="ui/branding/semantic-ui/less/globals/site.variables" copy
@brandColor: rgba(13, 95, 137, 0.8);
```

For further branding purposes, the most prominent and persistent UI elements are page header and footer 
and actionable elements (like buttons). You can
either set them to the `@brandColor` defined above, or
override appearance of those by modifying the following CSS variables:

```less filename="ui/branding/semantic-ui/less/globals/site.variables" copy
/* Override @primaryColor to override the site-wide primary accents on actionable elements. */
@primaryColor: 'blue';
/* Alternatively, use @brandColor for primary accents */
@primaryColor: @brandColor;

/* Header can contain either image based or solid color background */
@navbarBackgroundColor: blue;
@navbarBackgroundImage: linear-gradient(12deg, blue, blue 15%, rgba(251, 130, 115, 0.69));
/* You can also reference image assets inside your branding folder. */
@navbarBackgroundImage: url("~@less/images/your_image.png");

/* Footer */
@footerLightColor: @brandColor;
@footerDarkColor: /* a shade of your brandColor */;
```
