# Theme

This guide will help you to customize overall look-and-feel of your NRP repository, so that it better reflects your brand's identity.
It provides step-by-step instructions for configuring key elements of your brand's theme, including color scheme, typography, slogans and logos.

<Callout type="info">
Theming system used by NRP is based on [Semantic UI theming](https://semantic-ui.com/usage/theming.html) and 
[Invenio Semantic UI theme](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-theme/tree/master/invenio_theme/assets/semantic-ui/less/invenio_theme/theme) package.
</Callout>

User interface of a typical NRP repository site comprises of configuration-driven page templates and many themed Semantic UI elements and components, which are initially configured to use the `default` Semantic UI theme. User interface appearance can be customized by the methods described below.

## Theming methods

### Modify Invenio configuration

You can customize theme of your site by setting configuration options either in `invenio.cfg` or `variables` file present in the root of your repository project:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="myrepo" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="..." />
    <FileTree.File name="..." />
    <FileTree.File name="invenio.cfg" active={true} />
    <FileTree.File name="variables" active={true} />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

For a complete list of possible configuration options, please refer to:

</Cards>

### Create/override files under branding folder

You can also place your custom files, or customize existing ones, under the `branding` folder created in your project:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="myrepo" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="ui" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="branding" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.Folder name="semantic-ui" defaultOpen>
              <FileTree.Folder name="js"></FileTree.Folder>
              <FileTree.Folder name="less" defaultOpen></FileTree.Folder>
              <FileTree.Folder name="templates"></FileTree.Folder>
            </FileTree.Folder>
            <FileTree.Folder name="templates" />
            <FileTree.File name="__init__.py" />
            <FileTree.File name="webpack.py" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

When customizing your brand theme, most of the time you'll be spending in the context of `ui/branding/semantic-ui/less` and `templates` folders.
