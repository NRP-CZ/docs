# Theme

This guide will help you tailor the look and feel of your Invenio repository instance to reflect your brand's identity.
We'll walk you through step-by-step instructions for configuring key elements of your theme, including color schemes, typography, slogans, and logos.

<Callout type="info">
The theming system used by Invenio is based on <a href="https://semantic-ui.com/usage/theming.html">Semantic UI theming</a>
and the <a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-theme/tree/master/invenio_theme/assets/semantic-ui/less/invenio_theme/theme">Invenio Semantic UI theme</a> package.
</Callout>

The user interface of a typical Invenio repository site consists of configuration-driven page templates and themed Semantic UI elements,
which are initially configured to use the default Invenio theme. You can customize the appearance of your site using the methods described below.

## Theming Methods

### Modifying Invenio Configuration

You can customize your site's theme by setting configuration options in either the `invenio.cfg` file or the `variables` file (where each key must be prefixed with `INVENIO_`) located in the root of your repository project:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="myrepo" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="..." />
    <FileTree.File name="..." />
    <FileTree.File name="invenio.cfg" active={true} />
    <FileTree.File name="variables" active={true} />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

For a complete list of possible configuration options, please refer to:

### Creating/Overriding Files under the Branding Folder

You can also place custom files or customize existing ones under the `branding` folder created in your project:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="myrepo" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="ui" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="branding" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.Folder name="semantic-ui" defaultOpen>
              <FileTree.Folder name="js"></FileTree.Folder>
              <FileTree.Folder name="less" defaultOpen></FileTree.Folder>
              <FileTree.Folder name="templates"></FileTree.Folder>
            </FileTree.Folder>
            <FileTree.Folder name="templates" />
            <FileTree.File name="__init__.py" />
            <FileTree.File name="webpack.py" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

When customizing your brand theme, you'll likely spend most of your time working within the `ui/branding/semantic-ui/less` and `templates` folders.

## Theme Hierarchy

Invenio applies the following theme hierarchy when applying any styling rules and variables:
