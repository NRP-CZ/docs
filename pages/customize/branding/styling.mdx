# Styling <Difficulty level="intermediate" />

Styling rules are useful when you need to customize the appearance of existing UI components and elements in your repository site.
This can include changing the color scheme, fonts, sizing, or other visual aspects.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into styling, it's recommended that you have a basic understanding of:
- **[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)** (Cascading Style Sheets): a styling language used to control the layout and appearance of web pages.
- **[LESS](https://lesscss.org/)**: a CSS preprocessor that extends the functionality of CSS with features like variables, nesting, and mixins.

## Global Variables

The `site.variables` file allows you to define or override LESS variables that are used as defaults by all existing UI elements site-wide.
This file is located in the `ui/branding/semantic-ui/less/globals` folder:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="ui/branding/semantic-ui" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="less" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="globals" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="site.variables" active={true} />
        <FileTree.File name="site.overrides" active={false} />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

For a complete list of possible LESS styling variables, please refer to:

  />
</Cards>

You can also define your own variables here and use it later in your custom styling rules.

## Global Stylesheet

The `site.overrides` is used for global styling rules, such as any font faces or CSS reset styles, that should be applied once and before any other component-specific style
overrides:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="ui/branding/semantic-ui" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="less" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="globals" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="site.variables" active={false} />
        <FileTree.File name="site.overrides" active={true} />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>


## Customize Components

To customize the appearance of a UI component, you can override its default variables and/or style rules.

For a full list of UI components usable in a NRP repository site, please refer to:

</Cards>

 Here's an example of how to customize the  [`Button`](https://semantic-ui.com/elements/button.html) component:

### Variable Overrides

Look up the default variable definitions for the component you want to customize under the default `{componentType}/{component}.variables` definition
and find out a variable that you want to tweak to get the desired effect. Then override that variable by defining it in the `{componentType}/{component}.variables` file under the [`branding`](/customize/branding/theme#creatingoverriding-files-under-the-branding-folder) folder.

  />
</Cards>

If we were tasked to tweak the buttons to have a **shadow** of size `16px` and that cool **rounded borders** with radius of `8px`, we need to go through the following process:

<Steps>
#### Find the right variable names

Look up the correct variable names in the default [button.variables](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/blob/master/src/themes/default/elements/button.variables) file.

We can see there, that the variables controlling the border radius and shadows are:

```less filename="/Semantic-UI//src/themes/default/elements/button.variables" copy {1,3}
@borderRadius: @defaultBorderRadius;
/* ... */
@shadowDistance: 0em;
@shadowOffset: (@shadowDistance / 2);
@shadowBoxShadow: 0px -@shadowDistance 0px 0px @borderColor inset;
```

<Callout emoji="💡">
  When unsure about which variable controls what styles/appearance properties or what
  it's being used for, you might need to consult the
  [definition](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/tree/master/src/definitions)
  of the component of interest.
</Callout>

#### Create .variables file with customizations

In order to override values of these LESS variables, we create a corresponding `button.variables` file inside the [`branding`](/customize/branding/theme#createoverride-files-under-branding-folder) folder structure. We need to respect the theme folder structure imposed by Semantic UI:

`{themeName}/{componentType}s/{componentName}.variables`

As we use the `default` theme and the Button is a [component of type `element`](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/blob/master/src/definitions/elements/button.less#L15), the correct path would end with: `default/elements/button.variables`. Place just the variables that we need to customize there and we're done.

```less filename="ui/branding/semantic-ui/less/default/elements/button.variables" copy
@borderRadius: 8px;
@shadowDistance: 16px;
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You might need to manually create the folder structure if it doesn't exist
  yet.
</Callout>

</Steps>

### Style overrides

For situations, where there is no suitable variable defined on the component you want to tweak, you can completely override or add your own style rules for such a component.

For example, there is no way to affect button's `min-height` attribute using LESS variables. If we were tasked to change buttons on our site to have
`min-height` of `2rem`, we need to do the following:

<Steps>
#### Find the rule you want to override
Look up styles definition (`.less` file) of your component of interest, e.g. for our [button](
https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/blob/master/src/definitions/elements/button.less#L24-L57) (we can see the rule
controlling `min-height` there, it is `ui.button`):

```less filename="/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/blob/master/src/definitions/elements/button.less" copy {5,9}
/*******************************
            Button
*******************************/

.ui.button {
  cursor: pointer;
  display: inline-block;

  min-height: 1em;

  outline: none;
  border: none;
  vertical-align: @verticalAlign;
  background: @background;
  color: @textColor;

  font-family: @fontFamily;
  // ...
}
```

#### Define custom rules in overrides

Using a similar approach to [overriding variables](#create-custom-variables-file), we put our style rules 
into a custom overrides file. The path needs to respect the theme folder structure imposed by Semantic UI:

`{themeName}/{componentType}s/{componentName}.overrides`

We redefine the `ui.button` class there:

```less filename="ui/branding/semantic-ui/less/default/elements/button.overrides" copy {5}
.ui.button {
  cursor: pointer;
  display: inline-block;

  min-height: 2em;

  outline: none;
  border: none;
  vertical-align: @verticalAlign;
  background: @background;
  color: @textColor;

  font-family: @fontFamily;
  // ... same declarations as in original rule
}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You might need to manually create the folder structure if it doesn't exist
  yet.
</Callout>

#### (optional) Combine with custom variables

You can further combine the two customization approaches described here. Create a custom LESS variable and reference it from this overriden rule, to make `min-height` easily tweakable like other variable-driven button attributes:

```less filename="ui/branding/semantic-ui/less/default/elements/button.variables" copy
@minHeight: 2rem;
```

```less filename="ui/branding/semantic-ui/less/default/elements/button.overrides" copy {5}
.ui.button {
  cursor: pointer;
  display: inline-block;

  min-height: @minHeight;
  // ... same declarations as above
```
</Steps>
