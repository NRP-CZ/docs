# Styling <Difficulty level="easy" />

Style rules are useful for situations, when you need to customize color scheme,
fonts, sizing or other appearance of existing UI components and elements living in your repository site.

## Prerequisites

Before diving any further, it's recommended that you have atleast a basic understanding of **[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)** (Cascading Style Sheets) and **[LESS](https://lesscss.org/)**.

## Global variables

The `site.variables` file has been created for you to define/override LESS variables that are used as defaults by all existing UI elements site-wide.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="ui/branding/semantic-ui" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="less" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="globals" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="site.variables" active={true} />
        <FileTree.File name="site.overrides" active={false} />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

For a complete list of possible LESS styling variables, please refer to:

  />
</Cards>

## Global stylesheet

Any global styling rules (such as font faces, CSS reset styles), which should be applied just once and before any other component-specific styles, should be placed into the `branding.less` file:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="ui/branding/semantic-ui" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="less" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="branding.less" active={true} />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## Default component styles

The `site.overrides` file has been created for you to define/override default LESS style rules that gets inherited by all existing UI components site-wide.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="ui/branding/semantic-ui" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="less" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="globals" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="site.variables" active={false} />
        <FileTree.File name="site.overrides" active={true} />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  You want to keep this file's content minimal. People commonly confuse this
  file with a [global stylesheet](#global-stylesheet). In reality, any rules
  here gets duplicated as a base stylesheet for each and every existing UI
  component, increasing total bundle size.
</Callout>

## Customize components

Appearance of any Semantic UI component can be tweaked by overriding its default variables and/or style rules. Here we demonstrate, how to customize appearance of the [`Button`](https://semantic-ui.com/elements/button.html) component used to display buttons on pages, but the process is the same for any other component.

  />
</Cards>

## Variable overrides

The easiest way to change a component's appearance is to look up the default `{componentType}/{component}.variables` definition
and find a variable that you need to tweak to get the desired effect. Then override that variable by putting it in the `{componentType}/{component}.variables` file under your [`branding`](/customize/branding/theme#createoverride-files-under-branding-folder) folder.

If we were tasked to tweak the button to have a **shadow** of size `16px` and that cool **rounded borders** with radius of `8px`, we would need to follow the following process:

<Steps>
### Find the right variable names

Look up the correct variable names in the default [button.variables](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/blob/master/src/themes/default/elements/button.variables) file.

We can see there, that the variables controlling the border radius and shadows are:

```less filename="/Semantic-UI//src/themes/default/elements/button.variables" copy {1,3}
@borderRadius: @defaultBorderRadius;
/* ... */
@shadowDistance: 0em;
@shadowOffset: (@shadowDistance / 2);
@shadowBoxShadow: 0px -@shadowDistance 0px 0px @borderColor inset;
```

<Callout emoji="💡">
  If unsure, which variable controls which styles/appearance properties or what
  it's being used for, you might need to consult the
  [definition](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/tree/master/src/definitions)
  of the component of interest.
</Callout>

### Create custom variables file

In order to override values of these variables, we create a corresponding `button.variables` file inside the [`branding`](/customize/branding/theme#createoverride-files-under-branding-folder) folder structure. We need to respect the theme folder structure imposed by Semantic UI:

`{themeName}/{componentType}s/{componentName}.variables`

Since we use the `default` theme and the Button is a [component of type `element`](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/blob/master/src/definitions/elements/button.less#L15), the correct path would end with: `default/elements/button.variables`. Place just the variables that we need to customize there and we're done.

```less filename="ui/branding/semantic-ui/less/default/elements/button.variables" copy
@borderRadius: 8px;
@shadowDistance: 16px;
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You might need to manually create the folder structure if it doesn't exist
  yet.
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Style overrides

For situations, where there is no suitable variable defined on the component you want to tweak, you can completely override or extend style rules for such a component.
