# Templating <Difficulty level="beginner" />

Templating is used to customize mainly a large portions of the user interface and/or
to change page layouts, or to create a completely new pages for the Invenio repository.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into templating, it's recommended that you have an understanding of [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/),
which is the templating language of choice for Invenio repositories.

## Changing The Templates

What templates are used to render which pages, is determined mostly by [Invenio site configuration](/customize/branding/theme#modifying-invenio-configuration).
It is a common convention that configuration options regarding the templates usually contains the `_TEMPLATE` suffix in the name.

Jinja templates are `.html` files with Jinja syntax. Any custom templates should be created and placed under the registered `templates` folder.

## Template Inheritance And Composition

It is a common practice to compose the final page from one or more templates by leveraging Jinja's [Template inheritance](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/templates/#template-inheritance) mechanism.

Usually you would have a [base page template](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-theme/blob/master/invenio_theme/templates/invenio_theme/page.html), which provides just the overall page layout and a few extension points (e.g.: `{% block header %}`).
Other templates inheriting from it (`{% extends "base.html" %}`) could then extend the base template by providing their own content for the extension points. (e.g. by providing a header text for the `header` block).

## Referencing Templates

Template references (either in Invenio site config, or when referenced from other templates) are resolved as paths **relative** to the registered `templates` folders.
For example with this file structure:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="myrepo" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="ui" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="branding" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.Folder name="semantic-ui" defaultOpen>
              <FileTree.Folder name="templates" defaultOpen>
                <FileTree.Folder name="custom" defaultOpen>
                    <FileTree.File name="myfooter.html"/>
                </FileTree.Folder>
                </FileTree.Folder>
            </FileTree.Folder>
        </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

wherever I'd like to use `myfooter.html` template, I would refer to it as `custom/myfooter.html`.

## Example

<Callout type="info">
TODO: this part needs more work.
</Callout>


## Advanced Templating with JinjaX <Difficulty level="advanced" />

In NRP-based Invenio repositories, apart from using regular Jinja macros, it is possible to
create a reusable Jinja snippets / components with a clearly defined interface of accepted
properties (usage is similar to React UI components) by using the [JinjaX](https://github.com/jpsca/jinjax) extension.

You can recongnize JinjaX components by the camel-cased filename, `.jinja` file extension and usually the:
```jinja
{# def message="hello world!", ... #}
```
properties definition header.

<Callout type="info">
TODO: this part needs more work.
