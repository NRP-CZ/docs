# Configuration example

Repository of measurement data with a workflow for creating, approving, and publishing records.

## Roles:
  * researcher (provides files, creates records)
  * supervisor (approves metadata of records)
  * publisher (decides that data should/should not be embargoed and publishes)
  * community member (another researcher within the same community)
  * repository member (another researcher from another community)
  * general audience (anonymous user/any user)
  * curator (owner of the community, responsible for assigning roles within the community)
  * repository administrator (creates communities, assigns community owners)

## Workflow:
TODO: obrazek

## Configuration

```python
# invenio.cfg
from oarepo_workflows import Workflow

WORKFLOWS={
  "default": Workflow(
    label = _('Default workflow'),
    permission_policy_cls =  DefaultWorkflowPermissions,
    request_policy_cls = DefaultWorkflowRequests,
  )
}
```

```python
# shared/workflows/default/permissions.py

from oarepo_workflows import WorkflowPermissionPolicy
from oarepo_workflows.permissions import (
  AnyUser, CommunityMembers, CommunityRole, RecordOwner,
  SystemProcess, IfInState, IfRestricted
)

class DefaultWorkflowPermissions(WorkflowPermissionPolicy):

    can_create = [
        CommunityRole("researcher"),
    ]

    can_read = [
        RecordOwner(),
        CommunityRole("curator"),
        IfInState("approving", CommunityRole("supervisor")),
        IfInState("approved", CommunityRole("supervisor"),
                  CommunityRole("publisher"), CommunityMembers()),
        IfInState("published",
            IfRestricted(
                "visibility",
                then_=[CommunityMembers()],
                else_=[AnyUser()],
            )
        ),
        IfInState("deleting", CommunityRole("supervisor"),
                  RecordOwner(), CommunityRole("curator")),
    ]

    can_update = [
        IfInState("draft", RecordOwner(), CommunityRole("supervisor")),
        IfInState("approving", CommunityRole("supervisor")),
    ]

    can_delete = [
        IfInState("draft", RecordOwner(), CommunityRole("supervisor")),
        IfInState("approving", CommunityRole("supervisor")),
        IfInState("approved", CommunityRole("supervisor")),
    ]
```

Note: `SystemProcess()` is added automatically to all permissions.

## Requests
