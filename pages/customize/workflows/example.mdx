# Configuration example

Repository of measurement data with a workflow for creating, approving, and publishing records.

## Roles:
  * researcher (provides files, creates records)
  * supervisor (approves metadata of records)
  * publisher (decides that data should/should not be embargoed and publishes)
  * community member (another researcher within the same community)
  * repository member (another researcher from another community)
  * general audience (anonymous user/any user)
  * curator (owner of the community, responsible for assigning roles within the community)
  * repository administrator (creates communities, assigns community owners)

## Workflow:
TODO: obrazek

## Configuration

```python
# invenio.cfg
from oarepo_workflows import Workflow

WORKFLOWS={
  "default": Workflow(
    label = _('Default workflow'),
    permission_policy_cls =  DefaultWorkflowPermissions,
    request_policy_cls = DefaultWorkflowRequests,
  )
}
```

```python
# shared/workflows/default/permissions.py

class DefaultWorkflowPermissions(WorkflowPermissionPolicy):
    can_create = [
        CommunityRole("editor"),
    ]

    can_read = [
        RecordOwners(),
        # curator can see the record in any state
        CommunityRole("curator"),
        # administrator can see everything
        UserWithRole("administrator"),
        # if the record is published and restricted, only members of the community can see it,
        # otherwise, any user can see it
        IfInState(
            "published",
            then_=[
                IfRestricted(
                    "visibility",
                    then_=[CommunityMembers()],
                    else_=[AnyUser()],
                )
            ],
        ),

        IfInState("retracting", then_=[RecordOwners(), CommunityRole("curator")]),
    ]

    can_update = [
        IfInState(
            "draft",
            then_=[
                RecordOwners(),
                CommunityRole("curator"),
                UserWithRole("administrator"),
            ],
        ),
        # if not draft, can not be directly updated by any means, must use request
    ]

    can_delete = [
        # draft can be deleted, published record must be deleted via request
        IfInState(
            "draft",
            then_=[
                RecordOwners(),
                CommunityRole("curator"),
                UserWithRole("administrator"),
            ],
        ),
    ]
```

Note: `SystemProcess()` is added automatically to all permissions.
