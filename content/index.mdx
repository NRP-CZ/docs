The **Czech National Repository Platform (NRP)** is a nationwide initiative that provides a unified, sustainable ecosystem for operating digital repositories across the Czech Republic. It aligns standards, services, and infrastructure to support the effective management, preservation, and dissemination of research outputs and cultural heritage.

This site documents the **Invenio-based part of NRP**, which forms one of the core technological pillars of the platform. While the broader NRP ecosystem spans multiple repository technologies and shared national services, the content here is focused exclusively on repositories based on **InvenioRDM**.

## Scope

This documentation covers:

- The architecture, configuration, development and operation of NRP repositories based on [**InvenioRDM** software](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/).
- **NRP-specific extensions** for Invenio, including:
  - metadata model tooling  
  - vocabulary and taxonomy management  
  - UI customization and frontend build processes  
  - packaging, deployment, and orchestration patterns
- Guidance for **users**, **developers**, **integrators**, and **administrators** working on Invenio-based services under the NRP umbrella.

## Relationship to the NRP Project

This site complements the high-level documentation available at: https://docs.nrp.eosc.cz/

The main NRP documentation describes:

- project governance  
- national shared services (authentication, PID infrastructure, harvesting, long-term preservation)  
- institution onboarding  
- interoperability standards  
- overall platform architecture

## Intended Audience

- **Software engineers and frontend developers** working with NRP Invenio modules  
- **Repository administrators and DevOps teams** deploying or configuring Invenio-based repositories  
- **Institutional integrators** adapting Invenio to local institutional needs while maintaining NRP compatibility
- **End users and researchers** seeking guidance on using NRP Invenio repositories effectively
