# External authority provider <Difficulty level="intermediate" />

An External Authority Provider is a component for integrating custom external authorities with Invenio.
By developing an external authority provider, you can seamlessly incorporate vocabulary-compatible records
from external sources such as Research Organization Registry (ROR) or Digital Object Identifier (DOI) system into
Invenio. This integration enables Invenio to leverage authoritative and standardized data from these external sources,
ensuring consistency, accuracy, and interoperability within your digital repository.

This documentation will guide you through the process of creating
and configuring an external authority provider, detailing the necessary steps and considerations for successful
integration.

## Prerequisites

The following documentation assumes a decent knowledge of Python, REST APIs and React.

## Implementation

To implement a custom authority provider, you will need to create your provider class,
implementing at least the methods from the `AuthorityProvider` base class, for example:

```python
from oarepo_vocabularies.authorities.providers import AuthorityProvider

class MyProvider(AuthorityProvider):
    def search(self, identity, params, **kwargs):
        """
        Search the external authority service by the given text query.

        @param identity current user identity
        @param params   query parameters dict in form of {"q": string, "page": number, ...}
        @returns        a tuple of: (items, total?, page_size?)
        """

        # TODO: do any necessary network requests to the authority APIs here
        results = my_external_api.search(params)

        # TODO: transform result items to vocabulary format
        items = [to_vocabulary_item(item) for item in results]

        return items, 2, 10

    def get(self, identity, item_id, *, uow, value, **kwargs):
        """
        Gets vocabulary item by id. Returns the item as JSON or KeyError if the item could not be found.
        @param item_id  value['id']
        @param uow      actual unit of work (if you need to create something inside the db, do it inside this uow)
        @param value    the value passed from the client
        """

        # TODO: do any necessary network requests to the authority APIs here
        result = my_external_api.get(item_id)

        # TODO: transform result to vocabulary format
        return to_vocabulary_item(result)
```

Note that the `AuthorityProvider` class is responsible for querying the external authority APIs, and
converting returned records to acceptable vocabulary item format of:

```json
{
            "id": "my_id_type:recordid123",
            "title": "My external record",
            "tags": ["...", ...],
            "props": {
                # prop values must be strings
            },
            # NOTE: This attribute requires RelatedURICF Vocabulary custom field enabled.
            "relatedURI": {"my_id_type": "https://myexternalauthority/recordid123"}
}
```

## Usage

<Steps>
### Assign authority to vocabulary
    First, you need to enable the newly created authority provider on some vocabulary.
    For a complete guide, you can follow the [External authority for Vocabularies](/customize/vocabularies/authority)
documentation.

### Configure form inputs to suggest from authority
    To enable auto-suggestion feature, allowing suggestion & vocabulary additions from external authority,
add the following props to your `<VocabularySelectField>` inputs:

```jsx
<VocabularySelectField
    type="institutions"
    externalApiModalTitle={"Search in My Authority records"}
    externalApiButtonContent={i18next.t("Search in My Authority records")}
    externalAuthority={true}
    // other props as usual ...
/>
```

    Setting the `externalAuthority` prop will tell the select field to suggest e.g. items from the `institutions`
    vocabulary as it normally would, but when no item is found for the query, it will provide users
    an option to search for an item using an external authority provider you configured in the first step above.
