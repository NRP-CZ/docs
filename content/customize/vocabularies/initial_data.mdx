# Initial data for vocabularies <Difficulty level="easy" />

You have two options to add vocabularies to your repository:

1. Put the required vocabulary files into the `app_data` folder inside your repository
2. Create a python library with the vocabulary data and install it into your repository

## Using app_data folder

Files in the `app_data` folder are automatically detected and loaded during the
`./run.sh services setup` command and have the highest priority. The structure of the
`app_data` folder is as follows:

```bash
app_data
├── vocabularies           # folder containing vocabulary files
│   ├── languages.yaml     # vocabulary file for 'languages' vocabulary
│   └── names.yaml         # vocabulary file for 'names' vocabulary
└── vocabularies.yaml      # catalogue file defining the vocabularies to be imported
```

### Catalogue file

```yaml
The vocabularies that will be imported are defined in a fixture catalogue file. The file is located at
`app_data/vocabularies.yaml` and contains a list of vocabularies to be imported.

```yaml
languages:
  pid-type: v-lng
  data-file: vocabularies/languages.yaml
names:
  pid-type: names
  data-file: vocabularies/names.yaml
```

The `languages:` is the vocabulary identifier. It must be unique within the `vocabularies.yaml` file.
The next line, `pid-type: lng` specifies the pid type to be used for the vocabulary (must be unique within the repository and at most 6 characters long). The `data-file:` line specifies the path to the vocabulary file, relative to the `app-data` folder.

## Vocabulary file

Vocabulary file is a YAML document file containing the vocabulary records.

```yaml
# located at app_data/vocabularies/languages.yaml
- id: eng
  props:
    alpha_2: en
  tags:
  - individual
  - living
  title:
    en: English
- id: ces
  props:
    alpha_2: cs
  tags:
  - individual
  - living
  title:
    en: Czech
```

Each member of the array represents a single vocabulary item.
The first line specifies the id of the vocabulary item, which must be unique
within the particular vocabulary (languages in this case). The last section specifies the title
of the vocabulary item in different languages. You might add text props,
tags or custom fields here as well.
See [Invenio vocabularies schema](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-vocabularies/blob/master/invenio_vocabularies/records/jsonschemas/vocabularies/vocabulary-v1.0.0.json)
for more information.

## Using specific python package

## Development tips

For development purposes, you might want to speed up the initial data loading by reducing
the number of vocabulary terms loaded. You can do so by modifying the
`app_data/vocabularies.yaml` file to only include the vocabulary terms you need.
The vocabularies not listed in the catalogue will be loaded from the default Invenio RDM vocabularies package.
