# Copywriting <Difficulty level="easy" />

In this section, you'll explore how to tailor the language and messaging across your site to align with your brand voice and resonate with your target audience.

Effective copywriting is essential for engaging users, communicating value propositions, and guiding them through your repository site seamlessly. Follow the instructions below to personalize the copy and ensure consistency with your brand identity and messaging strategy.

## Titles

Learn how to update titles appearing throughout your NRP repository site with ease. It serves as the primary identifier of your site and is crucial for brand recognition. Change the following settings to ensure your site title reflects your brand accurately.

### Site name

This setting determines the name of the site to be displayed on the header and used as a page title.

<Tabs items={["invenio.cfg", "variables"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```python copy
config.configure_ui(
    # ...
    name=_("My new NRP repository!"),
    # ...
)
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
   <Tabs.Tab>
```python copy
INVENIO_REPOSITORY_NAME = 'My new NRP repository!';
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Title page repository description

The title shown on the front page of the repository site.


<Tabs items={["invenio.cfg", "variables"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```python copy
config.configure_ui(
    # ...
    description=_("My Repository site description"),
    # ...
)
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
   <Tabs.Tab>
```python copy
INVENIO_REPOSITORY_DESCRIPTION = 'My Repository site description';
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

There are more texts configurable via Invenio application configuration variables. For a more info, please consult the [Configuration Reference](/customize/configure/reference).

## Template texts

If you need more advanced text customization (beyond site name and title or other texts controlled via Invenio application config variable), you can override Jinja templates. This allows you to change most of the text appearing on the repository pages, including buttons, labels, hints, and other UI elements. For a detailed guide on how to override templates, please refer to the [Templating Customization](/customize/repository_ui/branding/templating) section.

## Best Practices & Tips

- Use translation functions (`_("") / lazy_gettext`) when writing custom template texts — this ensures that your custom text can later be translated into supported languages.
- Keep your branding copy concise and clear — front-page titles and slogans are powerful, so make sure they reflect your repository’s mission.
- Use environment-specific variables for settings that might differ between development, staging, and production deployments (e.g. a slightly different front-page title per environment).
