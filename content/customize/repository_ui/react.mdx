# React in our repositories

## Approach

As previously stated, our applications are multi page applications (MPA). Meaning, it is not a classical
React app, where you have one entry point and everything is rendered in the browser. Instead, we are using Flas for routing,
Jinja/JinjaX for rendering the pages embedding interactive widgets written in React.

This has some advantages and some disadvantages. The main advantage is that
this inherently means that the react applications are smaller and therefore less complex and easier to develop.
The main disadvantage is that there is no such a thing as a global state, which can sometimes complicate things.

## Main UI components

In context of React, main UI parts are the search page and the and record deposition form pages.
During the repository initial generation, after we create the model (./nrp model create model-name), basic React templates and
entry points for the search app and the form will be automatically generated for you (in the forms and search folders respectively).
We will discuss each of these individually in the following sections.
