# Front-end development of NRP repositories

The following guide provides an in-depth look at front-end development for NRP (National Repository Platform) repositories.
It provides comprehensive information on how to build, customize, and maintain the user interface components of NRP-based repository applications.

## Intended audience

This guide is intended both for developers that needs to develop new features for their own NRP repository instance
and core NRP developers or anyone wanting to contribute to the project's front-end ecosystem.

## Frontend Architecture Overview

NRP repositories use a hybrid approach combining server-side rendering with Jinja/JinjaX templates and client-side interactivity using React.

- **Jinja/JinjaX** for server-side rendering of record detail pages and other primarily static content
- **React** for interactive UI components and mini-applications 


This approach leverages the strengths of both technologies: server-rendered content for faster initial page loads and SEO benefits, combined with React's component-based architecture for complex interactive elements.

## Jinja/JinjaX for Record Detail Pages

Record detail pages are primarily rendered using Jinja/JinjaX templates. These templates:

- Are processed on the server side
- Receive data directly from the backend
- Generate HTML that is sent to the browser
- Provide excellent SEO capabilities
- Enable fast initial page loads

## React for Interactive UI Components

Most of our application's interactive UI is built with React, including:

- Search interfaces
- Form components
- Dashboard widgets
- Interactive data visualizations

## When to Use Which Technology

| Use Case                         | Technology   | Reasoning                               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Detail pages with static content | Jinja/JinjaX | SEO, fast initial load                  |
| Complex interactive elements     | React        | Component reuse, state management       |
| Forms                            | React        | Validation, dynamic fields              |
| Data visualization               | React        | Interactive charts, responsive displays |

## Design system

Our repositories are based on the Semantic UI design system. This means that all of the components that we use and also those that are coming from Invenio eco system
are also using Semantic UI. It is technically possible to use another design system, but it would require much more effort in terms of UI
development, therefore we recommend sticking with Semantic UI. Also all of the UI that your app is getting from our/Invenio source code
will be in Semantic UI, therefore, it will be difficult to achieve same look and feel accross the app if you
use different design system.

Semantic UI React is the official React integration for Semantic UI, available at [https://react.semantic-ui.com/](https://react.semantic-ui.com/).
For the static pages, you can use documentation of "regular" Semantic UI: https://semantic-ui.com/

## UI directory Structure

In our repositories, the UI section is organized as follows:

```
ui/model-name
├── semantic-ui
│   ├── js
│       └── model-name
│           ├── forms
│           │   ├── index.js
│           │   ├── FormActionsContainer.jsx
│           │   └── FormFieldsContainer.jsx
│           └── search
│               ├── index.js
│               ├── ResultsGridItem.jsx
│               └── ResultsListItem.jsx
├── templates
│   └── semantic-ui
│       └── model-name
│           ├── Deposit.jinja
│           ├── Detail.jinja
│           ├── Main.jinja
│           ├── Search.jinja
│           └── Sidebar.jinja
└── webpack.py

```

Note that you can have many folders under UI, and each one will have a similar structure. For example,
you will also have components folder that contains less components.

The most important thing to note is that here you have your jinjax templates for the detail, search and form pages and your javascript files.
Plus the webpack.py file, which is very important as it serves to add new javascript entry points, javascript aliases and javascript dependencies to
your project. It is basically a way to create your npm project via python.

Real example of UI folder for a project with model named documents:

### UI Resource views

UI Resource classes are Python classes tied to route views, responsible for fetching data from database and rendering it
through Jinja templates, ensuring a separation between backend logic and UI presentation.
