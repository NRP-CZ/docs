# Model UI

Model UI customization lets you tailor the user interface for specific record types in your repository. Each record model (datasets, publications, documents, etc.) can have its own customized search results, deposit forms, and detail views.

## What is Model UI?

In NRP repositories, **Model UI** refers to the front-end components and views that are specific to a record model. While the [Repository UI](/customize/repository_ui) provides shared components used across all pages, Model UI components are scoped to individual record types.

For example, a publication repository might need:
- **Search result items** that display journal names, DOI, and citation counts
- **Deposit forms** with fields for authors, affiliations, and publication venues
- **Detail pages** that show full citation data and download links

Each record model defines its own UI resources that handle these page views, and Model UI customization lets you override the defaults to match your specific needs.

**Model UI vs Repository UI:**
- **Repository UI** — Shared components, theming, templating, and generic UI infrastructure
- **Model UI** — Record-type-specific pages and components for search, deposit, and detail views

Both work together: Repository UI provides the foundation (components, templates, theming), while Model UI applies it to specific record types.
