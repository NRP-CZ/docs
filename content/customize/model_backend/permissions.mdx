# Permissions

## Pre-defined permission presets <Difficulty level="easy" />

When you create a new repository metadata schema, or extend an existing one,
you can use pre-defined permission presets to quickly set up the permissions for the schema.

To use a pre-defined permission preset, set the `XXXXX_PERMISSIONS_PRESETS` environment variable
to a list of presets that should be used. The `XXXXX` part of the environment variable name should be
the uppercase name of the schema. For example, if the schema is called `theses`, the environment variable
should be called `THESES_PERMISSIONS_PRESETS`.

**TODO: RDM 12 version, update to RDM14**
**TODO: remove this section completely when workflows are ported to RDM14**

Example:

```python
# invenio.cfg

THESES_PERMISSIONS_PRESETS = ["read_only", UCTThesisUploaderPermissionPolicy]
```

Permissions are evaluated as "OR" - that is, if any permission preset matches the current user, the user
will be granted the permissions. You can specify either the name of a pre-defined permission preset, or a
custom permission policy class.

The following pre-defined permission presets are available:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `read_only` | No one can modify the records, everyone has read-only access |
| `authenticated` | Authenticated users can modify the records |
| `everyone` | Everyone can modify the records |
| `community` | The community to which the record belongs defines the access rules |

## Custom permission policy <Difficulty level="intermediate" />

You can also define your own permission policy. To do this, you need to create a new class that
inherits from `invenio_records_permissions.policies.records.RecordPermissionPolicy`:

```python
class UCTThesisUploaderPermissionPolicy(RecordPermissionPolicy):
    """record policy for read only repository"""

    can_search = [UCTUploader(), AnyUser()]
    can_read = [UCTUploader(), AnyUser()]
    can_create = [UCTUploader()]
    can_update = [UCTUploader()]
    can_delete = [UCTUploader()]
    can_manage = [UCTUploader()]

    can_create_files = [UCTUploader()]
    can_set_content_files = [UCTUploader()]
    can_get_content_files = [UCTUploader(), AnyUser()]
    can_commit_files = [UCTUploader()]
    can_read_files = [UCTUploader(), AnyUser()]
    can_update_files = [UCTUploader()]
    can_delete_files = [UCTUploader()]

    can_edit = [UCTUploader()]
    can_new_version = [UCTUploader()]
    can_search_drafts = [UCTUploader()]
    can_read_draft = [UCTUploader()]
    can_update_draft = [UCTUploader()]
    can_delete_draft = [UCTUploader()]
    can_publish = [UCTUploader()]
    can_draft_create_files = [UCTUploader()]
    can_draft_set_content_files = [UCTUploader()]
    can_draft_get_content_files = [UCTUploader()]
    can_draft_commit_files = [UCTUploader()]
    can_draft_read_files = [UCTUploader()]
    can_draft_update_files = [UCTUploader()]
```

The names of the fields in the class are the names of the actions that can be performed on the records
prefixed with `can_`. The values of the fields are lists of permission checkers. The following can be used:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| AnyUser() | any user |
| AuthenticatedUser() | any authenticated user |
| SystemProcess() | the system process or superuser |
| SystemProcessWithoutSuperUser() | just system processes |
| RecordOwners() | people owning the record |
| AnyUserIfPublic() | any authenticated user if the record is public |
| UserWithRole("role") | any user with the specified role |

## Custom permission checkers <Difficulty level="advanced" />

You can also define your own permission checkers. To do this, you need to create a new class that
inherits from `invenio_records_permissions.generators.Generator` and provides needs and query filters:

```python
class UserWithRole(Generator):
    def __init__(self, *roles):
        self.roles = roles

    def needs(self, **kwargs):
        return [RoleNeed(role) for role in self.roles]

    def query_filter(self, identity=None, **kwargs):
        if not identity:
            return dsl.Q("match_none")
        for provide in identity.provides:
            if provide.method == "role" and provide.value in self.roles:
                return dsl.Q("match_all")
        return dsl.Q("match_none")
```
