# Configuration
    
InvenioRDM comes with a set of configuration options that can be adjusted to modify the behavior of various features and components.
On top of that, NRP introduces additional configuration options that are specific to NRP-based repositories through various extension packages.

Here is an overview of what could be achieved through configuration in NRP-based repositories.

## Configure a NRP repository

Invenio RDM configuration is based on Flask application configuration system. For more details on how to configure an InvenioRDM application, please refer to the
[InvenioRDM Configuration Documentation](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/operate/customize/look-and-feel/#setting-configuration-values).

NRP-based repositories use the same mechanisms for configuration as InvenioRDM applications. You can set configuration values in the `invenio.cfg` file, environment variables,
or variables file located in the root of your repository project.

On top of that, a helper [config module](https://github.com/oarepo/oarepo/tree/rdm-14/oarepo/config) is available for you to use in your `invenio.cfg` file to help you configure NRP-specific features by preset-based configuration approach.

An example `invenio.cfg` file using the helper config module might be as simple as:

```python
# invenio.cfg
from invenio_i18n import lazy_gettext as _
from oarepo import config

# localization / internationalization
config.initialize_i18n()

config.configure_generic_parameters()

config.configure_ui(
    code="myrepo",
    name=_("My NRP Repository"),
    description=_("My NRP-based repository for research data."),
)

config.configure_cron()
config.configure_stats()

import os
os.environ["DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH"]="/opt/homebrew/lib"

# datasets model registration
from mymodel import mymodel_model

mymodel_model.register()
DASHBOARD_RECORD_CREATE_URL = "/mymodel/uploads/new"
```

Or as complex as you need it to be. The `invenio.cfg` is a regular Python script, so you can use any Python code you need to set up your repository configuration.
