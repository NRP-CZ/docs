# Repository customizations

## Overview

NRP (National Repository Platform) builds upon [InvenioRDM](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/) and extends it to support **repositories with completely custom metadata models, deposit forms, and record detail pages** — all within a shared platform.

While InvenioRDM provides a unified data model and theming layer, NRP allows each repository to define its **own metadata schema** and corresponding **frontend components** that render, edit, and validate metadata in a tailored way.

This section explains how the customization layers fit together and what makes NRP's customization capabilities unique.

---

## InvenioRDM foundations

InvenioRDM offers a robust and extensible customization system covering:

- **Theming and look & feel:**  
  Custom Jinja templates, site branding, LESS/CSS overrides, and asset management.  
  See the official guide: [InvenioRDM Look and Feel Customization](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/operate/customize/look-and-feel/)

- **Frontend components:**  
  React-based pages for record deposit, search, and detail view, organized in “bundles” built via Webpack or Rspack.

- **Templating and asset pipeline:**  
  Each Python package can provide its own Jinja templates and static files, automatically discovered via Invenio's entry points.

These foundations apply equally to NRP repositories.

## What NRP adds

NRP extends the InvenioRDM architecture with a **model-driven customization layer**.  
Each repository is backed by a Python package that defines:

1. **A custom metadata schema**  
   Defined in JSON Schema, it specifies the structure of records stored in the repository.

2. **Generated UI configuration**  
   From the metadata schema, NRP generates a corresponding `ui.json` that describes how fields are displayed and edited — including labels, hints, input components, and validation rules.

3. **Custom React components and templates**  
   The repository package can include its own React components and Jinja templates for:
   - Record detail page (`record_detail.jsx`, `record_detail.html`)
   - Deposit form fields
   - Metadata previews, editors, or panels specific to that repository's schema

4. **Automatic discovery and integration**  
   During build time, NRP's frontend toolchain automatically collects and merges all UI components, templates, and assets from installed packages into a unified frontend build.

## Levels of customization

There are three typical levels of customization in NRP:

| Level | Scope | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Repository-level** | Global look and feel, branding, theming | Changing typography, color palette, logo, base pages layout, copywriting |
| **Model-level** | Record model related pages & components | Changing record detail page, search result item, deposition form |
| **Component-level** | Fine-grained overrides of UI components | Overriding how a date field or vocabulary selector is rendered |

Each level builds on the previous one, allowing you to customize globally or locally depending on your repository's needs.

## How this differs from InvenioRDM

| Aspect | InvenioRDM | NRP |
|--------|------------|-----|
| **Metadata model** | Single RDM schema (applies to all records) | One or more custom record schema |
| **Frontend** | Specific components implemented for a single RDM record schema | Higher-level components composed from shared RDM & NRP components |
| **Form configuration** | Static implementation specific to RDM record schema | Start with a basic form & plug-in more form fields according to record schema |
| **Search results** | Only single RDM schema-based type of record search result possible | Each record schema can have its own search result representation |
| **Customization goal** | Branding and small UI tweaks | Full domain-specific metadata UI per repository |

This means that in NRP, customizing the repository frontend is not just about changing colors or layout — it's about connecting your **metadata model** directly to your **user interface**.

## What's next

The following sections will guide you through:

- Adjusting the theme and templates of your repository
- Customizing the **record detail page**, **deposit form** and **search results** for your metadata schema
- Implementing custom React components and building assets using the NRP toolchain

For background reference, consult the upstream [InvenioRDM customization documentation](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/operate/customize/look-and-feel/)

## Repository-level Customizations

These affect **global look and feel, branding, and theming** across the repository. They generally do **not require coding**.

<Cards>
  <Card title='Branding & Theme' arrow href="/customize/branding/theme">
    <p>Change typography, color palette, logo, base page layout, and copywriting.</p>
  </Card>

  <Card title='Translations' arrow href="/customize/translations">
    Translate the UI into your language or customize existing labels and hints.
  </Card>

  <Card title='Vocabularies (initial data)' arrow href="/customize/vocabularies/initial_data">
    Provide default values for controlled vocabularies used across records.
  </Card>
</Cards>

---

## Model-level Customizations

These customizations are **specific to a repository's record models**. They affect pages and components related to records, search results, and forms.

<Cards>
  <Card title='Custom metadata fields' arrow href="/customize/record/custom_fields">
    Add new metadata fields to records. Supports simple types like text, dates, or controlled vocabularies.
  </Card>
  <Card title='Record landing page' arrow href="/customize/record/detail">
    Change the order or visibility of fields on the record detail page, or provide custom React components for advanced models.
  </Card>
  <Card title='Record deposition form' arrow href="/customize/record/deposit">
    Reorder fields in the deposit form or provide custom UI components for new field types.
  </Card>
  <Card title='Search results item' arrow href="/customize/record/search">
    Customize how search results are displayed, including fields, ordering, and faceting.
  </Card>
  <Card title='Record workflows' arrow href="/customize/workflows">
    Customize approval processes and workflows for the repository’s records.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Component-level Customizations

These require **coding experience in Python, Jinja, or React/JS**. They allow **fine-grained overrides** of UI components.

<Cards>
  <Card title='Page templates' arrow href="/customize/branding/templating">
    Modify page layouts or create your own templates using Jinja or React.
  </Card>
  <Card title='Complex custom fields' arrow href="/customize/record/complex_fields">
    Add metadata fields with complex data types, nested structures, or special widgets.
  </Card>
  <Card title='Complex validation' arrow href="/customize/record/complex_validation">
    Implement advanced validation rules for metadata fields, enforced in deposit forms and backend APIs.
  </Card>
  <Card title='Editable vocabularies' arrow href="/customize/vocabularies/editable">
    Allow users to create or extend controlled vocabulary items dynamically.
  </Card>
  <Card title='Fine-grained component overrides' arrow href="/customize/record/components">
    Override default React components for fields, record pages, or search items to change behavior or appearance.
  </Card>
</Cards>
