# Running an instance of a repository

Look at the [Getting started](/get_started) to check that you have all the prerequisites installed.

At first clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
❯ git clone <repository-url>
❯ cd <repository-name>
```

## Check that the basic tooling is running

```bash
❯ ./run.sh
Usage: run.sh command [options]

Commands:
  install                    Install the repository
  services setup             Setup docker services
  services start             Start docker services
  services stop              Stop docker services
  model create [config-file]   Create a new record model
  model update [model-name] [answers-file] Update an existing record model.
      Answers file is optional.
  run                        Run the repository
      [--no-services]        Do not start docker services
      [--no-celery]          Do not start background tasks
  cli [subcommand]           Run the invenio-cli command

  self-update                Update the runner script to the latest version
Options:
  --help                     Show this help message
```

## Check prerequisites

Let's check if all prerequisites are fulfilled. Run the following command in the repository directory:

```bash
❯ ./run.sh cli check-requirements -d

Checking pre-requirements...
Checking Python version...
Python version OK. Got 3.13.2.
Checking Pipenv is installed...
Pipenv OK. Got version 2025.0.4.
Checking Docker version...
Docker version OK. Got 28.3.3.
Checking Docker Compose version...
Docker Compose version OK. Got 2.39.2.
Checking Node version...
Node version OK. Got 20.9.0.
Checking NPM version...
NPM version OK. Got 10.1.0.
Checking ImageMagick version...
ImageMagick version OK. Got 7.1.2.
Checking git version...
git version OK. Got 2.50.1.
All requisites are fulfilled.
```

## Install the backend and build the frontend

If you are on Mac and using homebrew, you may need to patch the generated invenio.cfg to make installation work correctly. To do so, open `invenio.cfg` in a text editor and append at the end of the file the following lines:

```python
# hack to get invenio working on osx 26
import os
os.environ["DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH"]="/opt/homebrew/lib"
```

```bash
❯ ./run.sh install
```

The compilation will take a couple of minutes, as it needs to download and install all dependencies both for backend and frontend.

## Set up database and other services

After you have compiled the repository, you need to do the initial setup of the database and other services. Run the following command:

```bash
# the -N option is to skip adding demo data (in most cases you want that)
❯ ./run.sh services setup -N
```

*Note:* If you destroy the containers, please edit the `.invenio.private` and set `services_setup=False`. Then run `./run.sh services setup` again to recreate the database and other services.

## Run the repository

Finally, you can run the repository using the following command:

```bash
❯ ./run.sh run
```

This command will start the background services (database, search engine, etc.), background tasks and the repository itself. At the beginning, pending tasks from the services setup will be processed, so it may take a couple of minutes before the repository is fully operational.

After some time, the output will settle on:

```bash
Scheduler: Sending due task indexer
Task invenio_records_resources.tasks.manage_indexer_queues received
Task invenio_records_resources.tasks.manage_indexer_queues succeeded
```

This is a sign that all background tasks have been processed and the repository is running. Go to [https://127.0.0.1:5000/](https://127.0.0.1:5000/) and you should see the repository homepage.

## Create an initial user

To create an initial administrator user, open another terminal, change to the repository directory and run the following command:

```bash
❯ ./run.sh invenio users create -a -c <email>
```

and login with the created user.

## Create the initial bucket in S3

At this time the S3 storage does not have any buckets created. To create the initial bucket, log in to the minio web interface at [http://127.0.0.1:9000/](http://127.0.0.1:9000/) using the credentials that you find inside the `variables` file. Create a bucket named `default`.

## Create a sample record

To create a sample record, click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New Equipment". Fill in the metadata fields and save the record. Then upload a file to the record and look at the record preview page.
