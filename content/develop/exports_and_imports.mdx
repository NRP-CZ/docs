# Exports and imports

The internal format for storing metadata in the NRP is JSON that has structure
defined in the YAML models. However, users often need to export or import metadata
in various standard formats for interoperability with other systems or for data exchange.

This guide explains how to add custom export and import formats for metadata schemas.
We suppose that you have already created a custom metadata schema as described in the
[model customization guide](./model.md).

## Adding custom export formats

To add a new export format for your metadata schema, you need to create a serializer class
that converts the internal JSON representation to the desired export format. Let's do
an example: we will add a simple CSV export format for a metadata schema called `equipment`.
The CSV will contain only three fields: `name`, `serial_number` and `manufacturer`.

### Create the serializer class

At first, create a new Python file in the model directory, e.g., `equipment/serializers.py`
and add the following code:

```python
import csv
from flask_resources.serializers.base import BaseSerializer

class CSVSerializer(BaseSerializer):
