# Deployment to NRP Kubernetes Infrastructure

**TODO: RDM 12 version, update to RDM14**

## Terminology

As we will be talking about code repositories (such as github, gitlab, etc.), and
NRP repository instances (the actual running instances of the dataset repository),
we will be using the following terms:

* Source code repository - github, gitlab. Will be abbreviated as "github repository"/"gitlab repository"
* NRP repository - NRP implementation/instance for storing datasets, as running in k8s
* NRP repository source code - the source code of the NRP repository stored in github/gitlab

## Introduction

NRP-funded repositories typically run inside the Kubernetes cluster provided by CESNET,
the Academy of Sciences, or other partners within the National Repository Platform.

The following documentation describes the process at CESNET. The details might be
slightly different if you decide to deploy elsewhere. Note that the text below also
describes the deployment of an Invenio-based implementation.

## Base Image

The base image on which the NRP repository is built is provided by CESNET and is based
on the Python 3.12 Debian package. The current version can always be found in
[GitHub oarepo-images source code repository](https://github.com/oarepo/oarepo-images/blob/main/docker/).

## Building the Image of NRP Repository

The NRP repository image is built on top of the base image. The NRP repository source code is typically
stored in a GitHub source code repository. The Dockerfile used to build the image is not contained
within the repository source code, as we want to be able to upgrade the two independently.

For that reason, you can find the Dockerfile [in the oarepo-deployment source code repository](https://github.com/oarepo/oarepo-deployment/tree/rdm-12/docker/production).

To build the image, you will need to have access to CESNET's gitlab. We use it because
of it excellent integration with the Kubernetes cluster. CESNET's deployment team will
create a `deployment project` for your NRP repository. The `deployment project` is a project in gitlab
repository containing all the configuration needed to build / deploy your NRP repository.

In the gitlab project, go to `Pipelines` and
