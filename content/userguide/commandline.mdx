# NRP commandline tools <Difficulty level="easy" />

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    NRP commandline tools can currently be used only for NRP repositories
    based on Invenio technology stack. They can not be used to access
    repositories based on other technology stacks, such as DSpace,
    ARL or Islandora.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- python 3.13 or higher
- curl

## Example

```bash
# add a repository, will ask for token
nrp-cmd add repository https://data.narodni-repozitar.cz/ catchall --default

# create a new record and upload file to it. Store the record url to variable rec
nrp-cmd create record --community brno \
        '{"title": "My Record"}' \
        /tmp/myfile.txt '{"title":"My file"}' --set rec

# or with metadata in file
nrp-cmd create record --community brno \
        metadata.json \
        /tmp/myfile.txt /tmp/myfile-metadata.json --set rec

# publish the record
nrp-cmd publish record @rec
```

Bulk changes to records:

```bash
# get all records with publisher being 'myorg'
nrp-cmd scan records "metadata.publisher:myorg" --set ids

# download them together with files to the current directory as a backup
nrp-cmd download record @ids

# After carefully inspecting them, 
# change the publisher to 'myorg2' inside all the records
nrp-cmd update record @ids --path metadata.publisher myorg2
```

## Installation

### Using uvx

At first install the uv tool, see [uv installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for instructions.

Then just call `uvx nrp-cmd` to run the actual version of the `nrp-cmd` tool.

### Using pip and virtualenv

Run the following command to install the tool:

```bash
python3 -m venv nrp-cmd
source nrp-cmd/bin/activate
pip install nrp-cmd
```

For better comfort, create an alias in your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` file:

```bash
alias nrp-cmd="<path-to-nrp-cmd>/bin/nrp-cmd"
# or
alias nrp-cmd="uvx nrp-cmd"
```

Create a new terminal and try running `nrp-cmd`.

**Note:** The `nrp-cmd` command stores its configuration inside the `~/.nrp/invenio-config.json` file.
The file contains sensitive information, such as tokens, so make sure it is not accessible by other users.

## Getting help

Call the `nrp-cmd --help` command to get a list of available commands,
or `nrp-cmd <command> --help` to get help for a specific command.

## Managing repositories

### Adding a repository

The tool can work with multiple repositories. Each repository is
identified by an alias and one of the repositories is set as a default.

If you do not add any repository, you can still download public records,
but you will not be able to create or modify records nor access restricted records.

To add a repository, invoke:

```bash
nrp-cmd add repository <servername> <alias> [--token token] [--anonymous] [--default] [--no-verify-tls]
```

where the `servername` is either the full URL of the server, or just the
name of the host (e.g. `myserver.cesnet.cz`) and alias is an optional alias.
If you do not provide the alias, the first part of the servername (up to the first dot)
will be used.

If you do not specify the token, the command will try to open a repository login page
in your default browser. After you log in, it will redirect you to the `Personal tokens`
page, where you can create a token. Then copy the token to the terminal. The token will
be stored in the configuration file and used for subsequent requests.

You can skip this step by using the `--anonymous` option. If you do so, you will get
anonymous access to the repository - you will be able to read public records, but
not to create or modify them.

If you specify the `--default` option, the repository will be set as the default one.
The first repository added will be set as default automatically.

If you specify the `--no-verify-tls` option, the tool will not verify the TLS certificate
of the server. This is useful for testing purposes, but not recommended for production use.

**Hint**: For locally developed repository, use the following command:

```bash
nrp-cmd add repository https://127.0.0.1:5000/ --no-verify-tls
```

### Listing known repositories

To get a list of repositories, invoke:

```bash

nrp-cmd list repositories

Repositories

  Alias   URL                       Default
 ───────────────────────────────────────────
  repo    https://127.0.0.1:5000/   ✓

```

### Selecting the default repository

A default repository is used when no repository alias is specified in the command.
The first repository added will be set as default. To change the default repository,
run:

```bash
nrp-cmd select repository <alias>
```

### Removing a repository

To remove a repository, run:

```bash
nrp-cmd remove repository <alias>
```

## Repository introspection

### Basic information

To get information about the repository, invoke:

```bash
nrp-cmd describe repository [--output-format=table,json,yaml] [--refresh]<alias>
```

This command will return machine-understandable information about the repository,
such as name, description, metadata schemas, urls, etc.

By default it outputs tabular format, but you can select a format of the output
using the `--output-format` option.

The information is cached as we do not expect that the information changes frequently.
To refresh the information, use the `--refresh` option.

Sample output:

```text

  User Records URL        https://127.0.0.1:5000/api/user/docs/
```

## Variables

The tool supports variables which are used mostly for storing record identifiers. The variables are stored
inside the local directory in a file '.nrp/variables.json'. The file is created automatically when the first
variable is stored.

The following operations are available:

* `nrp-cmd list variables [--output <fname>] [--output-format table|json|yaml]` - list all variables.
* `nrp-cmd set variable <name> <value> [...<value>]` - sets the variable to the values specified
* `nrp-cmd get variable <name> [--output-format table|json|yaml] [--single-value]` - prints the variable to stdout
* `nrp-cmd remove variable <name>` - removes the variable


## Searching the repository


To search the repository, invoke one of the following commands (search and list are synonyms):

```bash
nrp-cmd search records [--repository <alias>] [modifiers] <query> [--set variable]
nrp-cmd list records [--repository <alias>] [modifiers] <query> [--set variable]
```

The optional query is a query string in the OpenSearch format. For example:

```bash
nrp-cmd search records "metadata.title:mytitle" --set mytitle_ids
```

### Modifiers

The following modifiers are supported:

* `--model` - name of the model which will be searched.
If not specified, all models will be searched. This option can be specified multiple times.
* `--community` - name (slug) of the community whose records will be searched.
If not specified, all communities will be searched. This option can be specified multiple times.
* `--size` - number of results to return. Default is 10.
* `--page` - page number to return. Default is 1.
* `--sort` - sort order. The default is `bestmatch`. The supported values are `bestmatch`, `newest`, `oldest`.
* `--draft` / `--no-draft` - if specified, only draft records will be returned.
* `--published` / `--no-published` - if specified, only published records will be returned.
* `--output-format <format>` - format of the output. The default is `yaml`.
The supported formats are `json` and `yaml`.

If multiple models, communities or collections are specified, the search will return results
from all of them in undefined order.

If the user is logged in, the search will also return private records.

### Variables

If you specify the `--set variable`, the urls of found records will be stored in the variable and can be used
in subsequent commands, such as `get` or `update`.

### Output

```yaml
hits:
- id: 1
  links:
    self: https://myserver.cesnet.cz/api/datasets/1
    self_html: https://myserver.cesnet.cz/datasets/1
  metadata:
    title: My dataset
- id: 2
  ...
total: 100
links:
  self: ...
  next: ...
  prev: ...
```

#### Pagination

To get the next page, run the command with `--page` option. For example:

```bash
nrp-cmd search records --page 2 myserver "title:mytitle"
```

Note that records might be repeated on different pages or some of the records can be skipped.

## Scanning records

If you want to get all records, use the following call:
    
```bash
nrp scan records [--repository <alias>] [modifiers] <query> 
```

The modifiers are the same as for the search command, 
except of `sort` and `page`, which are not supported.
The output will be always sorted from the oldest to the newest record.

The query is optional and can be used to filter the records.

For yaml output, the output will be a list of record documents:

```yaml
id: 1
...
---
id: 2
...
```

If you choose the json format, the output will be a list of records:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    ...
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    ...
  }
]
```

For easier processing, you can use the `jsonl` output format. The output will be a list of records
formatted as separate json documents on a single line:

```json
{"id": 1, ...}
{"id": 2, ...}
```

Bash example:

```bash
nrp-cmd scan records --output-format jsonl | while read REC ; do 
  echo $REC   # process the record
done
```

*Note:* the records will be output as soon as they are received. If there is any
communication error or the command is interrupted, the list of records will
be incomplete and in case of json output, the completion square bracket might be missing.

## Record identifiers

Several representations can be used to identify a record:

* `id` - this is the `id` field from search hit.
* `https://repository/api/model/id` - the `self` url of the record
* `https://repository/api/model/id/draft` - the `self` url of the draft record
* `https://repository/model-ui/id` - the `self_html` url of the record. The HTML page
must contain api metadata inside the head tag.
* `doi:10.3323/1234567` - a DOI allocated by the repository
(or any other supported external persistent identifier).
The DOI must be resolvable. A call to the DOI resolver will be made to get
the actual location of the record metadata.

## CRUD operations

### Reading record metadata

To get record metadata, invoke

```bash
nrp-cmd get record <pid> <pid> ...
```
where the `pid` is the record identifier in any of the supported formats, as defined above.

The command will output the record to stdout, for example in yaml:

```yaml
id: 1
links:
  self: https://myserver.cesnet.cz/api/datasets/1
  self_html: https://myserver.cesnet.cz/datasets/1
metadata:
  title: My dataset
```

You can specify additional parameters:

* `-o`, `--output fn` - will save the record as this output file
* `--repository <alias>` - will use the specified repository
* `--expand` - will add a list of files and requests to the output
* `--output-format` - will change the output format to `json` or `yaml`

The value of the `--output` can contain placeholders `{id}` which
will be replaced with the model name and the record id. The placeholders can also
reference metadata from within the record, such as `{metadata[title]}.json`.
Subdirectories are allowed within the `--output-file` and will be created if necessary.
The placeholders will be sanitized and `..` and leading `/` will be removed.

*Note:* You can use the `@variable` to get the record url from the variable. To download
multiple records with their files, use:

```bash
nrp-cmd search records "title:mytitle" --set mytitle_ids
nrp-cmd download record @mytitle_ids -o 'data/{id}'
```  

### Downloading a complete record

To download a complete record, invoke

```bash
nrp-cmd download record <pid> [-o directory]
```

where the `pid` is the record identifier in any of the supported formats, as defined above and

You can specify additional parameters:

* `-o`, `--output fn` - will save the record as this output file
* `--repository <alias>` - will use the specified repository
* `--model <model>` - will use the specified model in case the id is ambiguous
* `--expand` - will add a list of files and requests to the output
* `--output-format` - will change the output format to `json` or `yaml`

As above, the value of the `--output` can contain placeholders. If the output
is not provided, the record id will be used as the output directory.

This call will create the following structure:

```
<output>
  metadata.json
  files
    file1.txt
    file2.zip
```

### Creating a record

To create a record, invoke

```bash
nrp-cmd create record [--model <model>] <metadata> [<file> <file_metadata> ...] [--set variable]
```

where the `model` is the name of the model and the `metadata` is either a json string beginning with `{`
containing the metadata, or path on the filesystem to a file containing the metadata in either json or yaml format.
In case of path, the path must start with `/`, `./` or `../`.
A `-` can be used to read the metadata from stdin.

If model is not specified, either the repository must contain just one model or the model must be specified 
in the metadata (for example, using the `$schema` attribute).

All options:

* `--repository <alias>` - will use the specified repository
* `--model <model>` - will use the specified model in case the id is ambiguous
* `-o`, `--output fn` - will save the record as this output file
* `-f`, `--output-format json|yaml|table|jsonl` - will change the output format to `json` or `yaml`
* `--community <community>` - will create the record in the specified community
* `--workflow <workflow>` - will create the record with the specified workflow
* `--metadata-only` - will create the record with metadata only, files will not be uploaded

The command will output the created record to stdout, for example in yaml:

```yaml
# nrp-cmd create record documents '{"metadata":{"title": "blah"}}' --set blah

id: z2rrt-pz252
$schema: local://documents-1.0.0.json
created: '2024-03-14T13:30:01.133502+00:00'
errors:
- field: metadata.creators
  messages:
  - Missing data for required field.
- field: metadata.resourceType
  messages:
  - Missing data for required field.
files:
  enabled: true
links:
  draft: https://127.0.0.1:5000/api/docs/z2rrt-pz252/draft
  # more links here ...
parent:
  id: rcpyq-rx266
request_types:
- type_id: publish_draft
  links:
    actions:
      create: https://127.0.0.1:5000/api/requests
revision_id: 3
updated: '2024-03-14T13:30:01.154516+00:00'
metadata:
  title: blah
```

If you specify the `--set variable`, the identifier of the created record will be stored in the variable and can be used
in subsequent commands, such as `get` or `update`:

```yaml
# nrp-cmd get record @blah

id: z2rrt-pz252
# ... same result as above
```

### Updating a record

To update a record, invoke

```bash
nrp-cmd update record <pid> [--merge|--replace] <metadata>
nrp-cmd update record <pid> --path=<pth> <metadata>
```

where the `pid` is the record identifier in any of the supported formats, as defined above and metadata is either a json string beginning with `{`
containing the metadata, or path on the filesystem to a file containing the metadata in either json or yaml format.


All options:

* `--repository <alias>` - will use the specified repository
* `--model <model>` - will use the specified model in case the id is ambiguous
* `--replace` - will replace the metadata of the record. This is the default operation
* `--merge` - will merge the metadata of the record with the new metadata
* `--path <pth>` - will update the metadata at the specified path, not the whole metadata
* `-o`, `--output fn` - will save the record as this output file
* `--output-format` - will change the output format to `json` or `yaml`

The command will fetch the actual version of the record and update it with the new metadata.
If the `--merge` is used, the new and old metadata will be merged as follows:

* if the value is a scalar, the new value will replace the old value
* if the value is a list, the new list will be appended to the old list
* if the value is a dictionary, then for each key:
  * if the key is not present in the old dictionary, it will be added
  * if the key is present in the old dictionary, the value will be updated as above

`null` values will be removed from the metadata after the merge operation.

The command will output the updated record to stdout, for example in yaml:

The following two are equivalent and both update the `{'metadata': {'title': '...'}}` part of the record:

```bash
nrp-cmd update record @blah '{"title": "blah2"}'
nrp-cmd update record @blah --path title blah2
```

*Note:* the command always updates the "metadata" part of the record.
You can not update other parts of the record using this command.

### Deleting a record

To delete a record, invoke

```bash
nrp-cmd delete record <pid>
```

where the `pid` is the record identifier in any of the supported formats, as defined above.

## Files

### Listing files on a record

To list files on a record, invoke

```bash
nrp-cmd list files <pid>
```

where the `pid` is the record identifier in any of the supported formats, as defined above.
You can use the `@variable` to get the record url from the variable.
Also, all options from the `get record` command are supported.

```yaml
# nrp-cmd list files @blah

### Downloading a file

To download a file, invoke

```bash
nrp-cmd download file <pid> <file-key> <file-key> ... [-o output-file]
```

where the `pid` is the record identifier in any of the supported formats, as defined above and
`file-key` is the key of the file to download. The `output-file` is the path to the file where the file will be saved.
If you do not specify the `output-file`, the file will be saved to the current directory with the same name as the key.

If you specify multiple `file-key`s, the files will be downloaded to the current directory with the same name as the key.
In this case, you might use the `{var}` placeholder in the output file. The placeholder will be replaced with the value
from the file's metadata (for example, `{title}.pdf` will save the file as title). To keep the original extension,
use the `{ext}` placeholder.

To download all files, use the `*` as the `file-key`. Do not forget to escape it in the shell.

Note: If you download all files, it is preferable to use `nrp-cmd download record ...` command instead.
You will get all the metadata and it might be useful for provenance tracking.

### Uploading a file

To upload a file, invoke

```bash
nrp-cmd upload file <pid> <file> [<metadata>]
```

where the `pid` is the record identifier in any of the supported formats, as defined above.
If the metadata is not passed, the file will be uploaded with empty metadata.

### Updating file metadata

To update file metadata, invoke

```bash
nrp-cmd update file <pid> <file-key> <metadata>
```

where the `pid` is the record identifier in any of the supported formats, as defined above,
`file-key` is the key of the file to update and `metadata` is either a json string beginning
with `{` containing the metadata, or path on the filesystem to a file containing the metadata
in either json or yaml format.

### Deleting a file

To delete a file, invoke

```bash
nrp-cmd delete file <pid> <file-key>
```

### Re-uploading a file

To reupload a file, delete the file and upload it again.

## Publish and edit published document

### Publishing a draft

To publish a draft, invoke

```bash
nrp-cmd publish record <pid>
```

where the `pid` is the record identifier in any of the supported formats, as defined above.
The command will output the published record to stdout.

If you use a variable instead of the pid, the variable will be updated with the new identifier.

**Note:** the record is validated before publishing. If the validation fails, the command will fail
and print the validation errors instead of the record.

### Editing published record

To edit a published record, invoke

```bash
nrp-cmd edit record <pid> [--set variable]
```

where the `pid` is the record identifier in any of the supported formats, as defined above.
The pid must point to a published record and might be '@variable'.
The command will create draft record and output it to stdout.

### Creating a new version of a published record

If you want to replace files in a published record, you need to create a new version of the record.
To create a new version, invoke

```bash
nrp-cmd version record <pid> [--set variable]
```

## Requests

### Creating a request


To create a request, invoke

```bash
nrp-cmd create request <request_type_id> <record_id> [variable] [--submit]
```

where the `request_type_id` is the type of the request and `record_id` is the record identifier in any of the supported formats, as defined above.

You can store the identifier of the created request in a variable by providing the variable name as the third positional argument.

If you specify the `--submit` option, the request will be submitted immediately after creation.

### Getting a request

To get a request, invoke

```bash
nrp-cmd get request <request-id>

# or (using a stored variable)

nrp-cmd get request @variable
```

where `request-id` is the identifier (url) of the request. 
The command will output the request to stdout.
The command takes output file and format options as well, 
see the `get record` command for details.


### Updating a request with a new metadata

If the request has not been submitted, you can update the metadata of the request by invoking

```bash
nrp-cmd update request <request-id> <metadata>

# or (using a stored variable)

nrp-cmd update request @variable <metadata>
```
